## Release parts

### Engine

From the Ashes uses own version of OpenXcom game engine (like OXCE), and it is constantly improving with new features, that are impossible to implement with only ruleset additions (scope of usual mods).

### Content

Content part is similar to another megamods. OpenXcom loads any content like a mod, so basically, vanilla game and TFTD are also megamods, that are loaded to OpenXcom by default. You can notice it by examining "Mods" button in main menu. Engine loads all art, rulesets and datafiles from content and uses it to create in-game entities.
