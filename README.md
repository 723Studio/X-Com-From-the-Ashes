# X-COM: From the Ashes

Global conversion mod to OpenXcom. During the alien invasion, X-COM's initiative failed, alien agents infiltrated the ranks of most major governments, and within a few months, they were placed in a puppet regime. The true motives of the aliens remain obscure. Their hostile activities are skillfully hidden from the public.
There is no support from the Council of Funding Nations, and Council members loyal to X-COM are scattered and remain concealed. The player will need to learn how to survive in the new circumstances, conduct an undercover struggle against alien forces, and cooperate with global organizations involved in the conflict.

## Current version - **pre-alpha**

Mod is on it's initial development stage, all its aspects are WIP and im looking forward to present alpha 1 with playable version!

## OpenXcom engine

This mod is developing togeter with [dedicated engine](https://github.com/Finnik723/OpenXcom_FTA), that is a fork of [OpenXcom Extended](https://github.com/MeridianOXC/OpenXcom).
Though FtA megamod can be launched on conventions versions on the game engine, it's balance and plot highly depends on my engine's features, like diplomacy, covert operations and other exclusive mechanics. When mod would be released, it would be distributed together with demanded version of the OpenXcom engine.
