  STR_DAMAGE_ARMOR_PIERCING_TOPIC: "Kinetic Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_ARMOR_PIERCING_UFOPEDIA: "Weapons dealing kinetic damage are one of the most reliable and common types of weapons we use. This type of damage is inflicted by accelerating the projectile to a high speed (e.g., by the pressure of expanding propellant gases). It can cause bleeding on impact and the resulting damage reduces the target's combat ability. Because of the widespread use of this type of weapons various means to protect from them are just as common.  Some types of weapons have a certain armor penetration rate, which depends mainly on the type of the projectile and it's speed.{NEWLINE}Additionally, based on previous unfortunate encounters with aliens, we can assume that they have very effective ways of protecting against kinetic damage."
  STR_DAMAGE_INCENDIARY_TOPIC: "Incendiary Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_INCENDIARY_UFOPEDIA: "Incendiary weaponry is often brought into action for denying chokepoints or when standard ordonance is ineffective. A target set ablaze will take a small but not insignificant amount of damage over time for a while, regulated only by the target's flame resistance, rather than armor values too - afterall, the only ultimate difference between being cooked or charred alive is that in case of the former the remains can end up slightly less scorched. Burning targets will, understandably, loose more morale upon being hit than with other damage types too. Furthermore, enemies with at least a semblance of self-preservation instincts will avoid crossing burning areas unless absolutely necessary."
  STR_DAMAGE_HIGH_EXPLOSIVE_TOPIC: "High Explosive Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_HIGH_EXPLOSIVE_UFOPEDIA: Explosives are a tried and proven way of dislocating obstacles for accessing new routes and hostiles should there be too many of them to take out one by one or when there isn't a good opportunity to target them otherwise in the first place. Explosives, especially the ones specifically designed for that purpose, can also prove invaluable when dealing with highly armored opponents and vehicles. Care and restraint should be taken when using explosives, as a misplaced explosive can prove more detrimental to the user(s) than the designated target."

  STR_DAMAGE_STUN_TOPIC: "Stun Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_STUN_UFOPEDIA: "Sometimes killing an opponent can be unpreferable as they might hold important data to be extracted or ransomed away if absolutely necessary. That's where less-lethal tools come into play - batons, rubber rounds or even hand-to-hand combat with sufficient skill and training are the readily availabe means of pacifying a target, and they are by no means the only ones. However, as the name implies, these weapons are not entirely harmless - most of them also cause normal wounds, limiting their repeatability on a single target. They can also cause shock, resulting in a slow but constant loss of vital signs, until expiration.{NEWLINE}The Aliens also seem to have a ranged version of less-lethal weapons, of an area-of-effect type to boot."
  STR_DAMAGE_MELEE_TOPIC: "Cutting Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_MELEE_UFOPEDIA: "Melee weapons are among the simplest yet still effective types of weapons, bar armored opponents. At close range it might be preferable to dispatch an enemy using by the means of a combat knife or a similar implement given how quick they are to use, especially if the hostiles are the ones approaching. However, using it in other circumstances is inadvisable - risking overextension for an attack that might end up failing is always a bad decision but wanting to engage in melee combat can result in the worst cases of it should there be any complications. It's also relatively easy to be protected from cutting weapons; that goes either way."
  STR_DAMAGE_ACID_TOPIC: "Acid Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_ACID_UFOPEDIA: STR_DAMAGE_ACID_UFOPEDIA #TODO
  STR_DAMAGE_SMOKE_TOPIC: "Choke Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_SMOKE_UFOPEDIA: "Smoke can provide a helpful, if intangible, cover from enemy fire. It can also become a hazard - inhaling smoke from any source will eventually result in loss of consciousness from decreased access to oxygen. It can be used to facilitate captures but overstaying in smoke could end up in a shock not unlike the one caused by abuse of stun weaponry. Thus it's ill-adviced for wounded troops to stay long, or in worst cases at all, in smokescreens, grenade-made or otherwise."

  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE1_CAPTION: "The Council of Funding Nations has decided to terminate the X-COM project and all its activities. Perhaps this has something to do with the recent changes of Council membership, with several of its members facing clearly fabricated charges. Agents of a top secret supragovernmental organization known to us as the Men in Black have been assigned to the Council as the exclusive security force. We are confident that the purpose of this organization extends far beyond the protection services - there are reasons to suspect them of aiding the aliens, and they are trying to cover up any traces of their activity."
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE2_CAPTION: "The Commander of X-COM has been called to the Council to receive the final instructions. Two days later, he returned to the base accompanied by MiB agents and initiated the 'Oblivion' protocol: an irreversible encryption of the Ufopaedia (X-COM's archive of scientific and technological achievements), decreed dismissal of all personnel and issued orders to dismantle the base facilities."
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE3_CAPTION: "All of his colleagues noticed some peculiar changes in his behavior - communication became more drastic and formal and there was a steep decrease of empathy.

  STR_LOG1_UFOPEDIA: "As a senior officer, I took command. I hope I'm experienced enough to cope with the situation.{NEWLINE}Our enigmatic foe is retreating. When our soldiers got to the ground level of the base, the remaining men in black plunged into two black vans and fled eastwards. The attempt to follow them has failed.{NEWLINE}If you think about it, the situation overall is hardly better - we have lost the funding and supply source and know very little about our enemy. Apparently, alien agents have infiltrated deep into government structures, probably even the Council itself. What is clear is that now we can only count on ourselves.{NEWLINE}In the meantime, it is necessary to gather status reports on the core units and understand what we still have to do. We need to get reports from the chiefs of research, intelligence and logistics. I have already submitted orders, it will take several hours for analysis. After that, it will be possible to plan further actions."

  STR_INTEL_STATUS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Oh, Commander! Recent events have tied our hands entirely, all secret government communication channels have been cut off - we will have to build our agent network from scratch. You can assign a couple of scientists to set up new encrypted communication channels. It is essential to set up covert operations conducted by our agents to gather intelligence assets.{NEWLINE}Additionally, we can establish secure contact with our remaining friends, I have a few people I've been watching for a long time. Their help will be invaluable in the given circumstances."
  STR_ENGINEER_STATUS_REPORT: "Engineer's Report"
  STR_ENGINEER_STATUS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Greetings, Commander! Our base was in a very poor condition even before the attack. Due to a lack of funding, we were forced to close several facilities and sell off some valuable equipment. After closing the workshop our production capacity is at a minimum, we are trying to assemble spare parts from improvised materials. It is absolutely unclear where we will get the supplies from now, even the most basic ones. Intelligence has forbidden my guys to leave the base, and from where will we get everything we need for maintaining, not to mention building modules? Maybe R&D folks would think about the secure source of the general supplies?"
  STR_VEHICLES_STATUS_REPORT: "Vehicles Status"
  STR_VEHICLES_STATUS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Our vehicles are repaired, refueled, and ready to use. It's just that we don't have a radar system anymore. The intelligence guys are constantly monitoring reports of UFOs' signs all over the globe, but the real chance of alien ship tracking is very poor. Although if we manage to do that, Stalker-1 is ready for takeoff. Hopefully, it will get luckier than Stalker-2, hit by a burst of plasma. We've got a good deal of ammo left, but we don't have a restocking source - Stingray missiles aren't for sale at the supermarket, you know.

  STR_PRISONER_INTERROGATIONS: "Prisoner Interrogations"
  STR_PRISONER_INTERROGATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "I am proficient in many forms of interrogating suspects and I believe that this is the most effective way to obtain crucial insights that will help shed light on unfolding events. While some suspects may not have any vital knowledge, I advise you to interrogate all our captives. In addition to strategic intelligence, this will help us determine specific combat features of our enemies and identify their strengths and vulnerabilities. Our prison can hold up to 10 human prisoners, but for more exotic creatures we will have to design suitable containment units according to their biology."
  STR_UFOPEDIA_DECRYPTION: "Ufopaedia decryption"
  STR_UFOPEDIA: "Ufopaedia"
  STR_UFOPEDIA_UFOPEDIA: "We managed to break through the primary protection of the blocked Ufopaedia archive! Sadly, once we had accessed the system, we found inner layers of data encryption. One section seems to hold all the technical data on the equipment we use. It won't be difficult to decipher that part. The other is much better protected, and it seems that only the commander had access to it before the lockdown. I can't say for sure, but it most likely contains strategic data about the project history and its formation background. Perhaps the analysis of past events will allow us to avoid these errors in the future."

It is unlikely that we would have been able to access this data so extensively from other sources, as we've been cut from support from the Council and world governments who probably do not know that we still exist.

  STR_COMMUNICATION: "Communication"
  STR_COMMUNICATION_UFOPEDIA: "Most of the old government communication channels are no longer available to us, the rest are probably controlled by alien agents. Centralized use of direct radio links, even if encrypted, is not reasonable either - our enemies will be able to track the source of the signals and destroy it. Fortunately, we live in an age of booming decentralized computer networks! By hacking hundreds of thousands of personal computers online, our IT specialists have deployed an entire system of sophisticated proxy servers. Our encrypted messages are embedded in massive data flows and mixed with a vast amount of false messages being sent. Meanwhile, any attempt to track or intercept our traffic will immediately be detected and the data will be securely rerouted to another path, potentially enveloping the entire planet." #Onion routing FTW! -D
  STR_BASE_DEFENSE_COMBAT_ANALYSIS: "Base defense tactical analysis"
  STR_BASE_DEFENSE_COMBAT_ANALYSIS_UFOPEDIA: "Tactical analysis of the recent assault on our base has exposed several significant security vulnerabilities. Although most of the complex is underground, some of its modules have a direct connection to the surface. The obvious point of enemy penetration into the base is the entry lift. In addition, our aircraft perform vertical take-off from the hangars. Despite our attempts to disguise the closing casements of our hangars they can still be easily detected from the ground. Enemies blasted a few holes in the casements and went down on ropes inside. There is a good chance that our enemies will use the hangars to break into the base in the future as well. Unfortunately, these circumstances were not taken into account in the initial base design, and now we need to think about how to improve the defense systems, and also to pay more attention to the base layout."
  STR_COVERT_OPERATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "Due to the clear dominance of our enemy, the preferred strategy will be keeping a low profile when dealing with important strategic tasks. We can send our agents to covert operations for more subtle methods of solving a problem than an open attack. The secure channels we've developed allow us to coordinate agents remotely, and for some operations, it is also important to involve scientists for analytical work and engineers to design the special gear. A covert operation is always a risk, and in order to increase your success odds you should be careful when choosing your team and equipment. Any little thing, in the end, can play a key role."

  STR_RESISTANCE_CONTACT: "Contact with the Resistance"
  STR_RESISTANCE_CONTACT_UFOPEDIA: "The Resistance is a voluntary union of people not willing to obey the new world regime. This initiative began to emerge in the early '70s and in the beginning, consisted of ufologists and conspiracy theorists. Who could ever guess that they would be in the right? In the past few years, the Resistance began to be joined by a large number of very different people - scientists, journalists, doctors, ordinary people, and even former military officers. They all had one thing in common - they had somehow come into contact with the aliens and now Men in Black are hunting them down. Most of those who have discovered even a little about the aliens after a very short time have disappeared under mysterious and often frightening circumstances. The rest learn to hide well and form guerrilla cells around the world. The goal of the Resistance is to unite and protect these disparate groups, reveal the mysterious plans of the invaders, and consolidate all mankind against an extraterrestrial threat."
  STR_SUPPLIES: "Supplies"
  STR_SUPPLIES_UFOPEDIA: "In the current circumstances we must act as carefully as possible to avoid unnecessary attention to ourselves. Fortunately, in many aspects our base is autonomous - we have a source of drinking water and electricity generators. We have developed a system by which we can organize safe purchases of food and basic supplies, and some simple spare parts in several nearby cities. We've had major funding issues for a long time, so we're already left with people who put the fight against aliens ahead of taking care of their personal earnings. We've resigned contracts with all the staff, all of them willing to continue working on the project voluntarily, as long as we take care of providing them with everything they need to work, and it would be good to keep the morale high."
  STR_LOYALTY: "Loyalty"
  STR_LOYALTY_UFOPEDIA: "The X-COM Project was officially shut down and now we can only count on ourselves. The loss of the Council’s support is a severe blow to our organization but despite all hard circumstances our people are determined to fight against alien invaders at all costs. Ad victoriam - that’s our new motto! Today isn’t money determining our future, but how strong our men’s spirit is. It is essential not to let the morale go down and there are many points of influence on it. The successful operations against our adversaries, major scientific and technological breakthroughs, and progress towards understanding the nature of our enemies, - all these factors will significantly raise the morale and bring the team together, that’s why we should be extremely careful and wise in our strategic and tactical choices."

Unfortunately, some of them had to be dismantled last year, and some had never been built. Since we have figured out how to get basic construction materials, we can start the construction work if necessary and if we have money to buy everything we need. Of course, it will take some time to remove soil, reinforce walls and ceilings, and install internal equipment. In addition, most of the specialized facilities require special equipment, and we will have to figure out how to get it."
