  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE1_CAPTION: "The Council of Funding Nations is closing the X-Com project and terminating of all its activities. Perhaps this has something to do with the recent changes of Council membership, with several Council members facing clearly fabricated charges. Agents of a top secret intergovernmental organization known to us as the Men in Black have been assigned to the Council as exclusive security force. We are confident that the purpose of this organization extends far beyond the protection services - there are reasons to suspect them of aiding the aliens, and it seems that they are trying to cover up any traces of their activity."
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE2_CAPTION: "The Commander of X-Com has been called to the Council to receive the final instructions. Two days later, he returned to the base accompanied by MiB agents and initiated the 'Oblivion' protocol: an irreversible encryption of the Ufopaedia (X-Com's archive of scientific and technological achievements), decreed dismissal of all personnel and issued orders to dismantle the base facilities."
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE3_CAPTION: "All colleagues noticed some peculiar changes in his behavior - communication became more drastic and formal, and there was a steep decrease of empathy. We have already documented such personality changes of some of our field agents, and we assume that this indicates some form of external mind control. You know the Commander well, he would never so easily destroy what we have been working so hard all these years!"
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE4_CAPTION: "Dr. Meyer, chief of the research department, tried to prevent the loss of research data. Unfortunately, he was not a trained spy and was caught trying to back up the Ufopedia. An MiB agent shot him on sight, and the Commander didn't even blink!"

#enemies
  STR_MIB_AGENT: "MiB Agent"
  STR_MIB_AGENT_UFOPEDIA: "After the MiB agent regained consciousness he looked very disoriented and even frightened. He couldn't clearly tell us who he is and how he got here. The last thing he remembers is how he left the house at night when he saw a strange glow in his cornfield. This happened in July 1996. Judging by his constitution, reaction and combat training, it's hard to believe that we're looking at a simple farmer. It'd be easier to believe he's an elite special agent, but we're pretty sure he's not lying. Unfortunately, all attempts to get more information have led to nothing."
  STR_MIB_AGENT_ARMOR: "MiB Agent Combat Analysis"

  STR_XCOM_EX_COMMANDER_EXAMINATION_UFOPEDIA: "Apparently, former Commander's mind is still under alien control, despite the loss of consciousness and prolonged imprisonment. At every opportunity, he shows aggression and refuses to communicate. All of our interrogation methods have proven ineffective, and the method aliens use to remain control is still unclear to us. During the physical examination, there were no signs of any surgical intervention, all medical tests within the normal range (except for adrenaline). Safekeeping is problematic, for example, once he had a chance and bite off a finger of a former colleague."

  STR_ASSAULT_RIFLE: "Assault Rifle"
  STR_ASSAULT_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "This rifle is designed for aggressive short- and medium-distance combat, with improved fire rate and accuracy in Auto and Snap shooting. The drawback is not the highest accuracy in long-range sights and not the best scope for Aimed firing."

When our soldiers got to the ground level of the base, remained men in black plunged into two black vans and fled eastwards. The attempt to follow them has failed.{NEWLINE}If you think about it, the situation is no worse - we have lost a funding and supply source and know very little about our enemy. Apparently, alien agents have managed to infiltrate deep into government structures, probably even the Council itself. What is clear is that now we can only count on ourselves.{NEWLINE}In the meantime, it is necessary to gather status reports on the core units and understand what we still have to go. We need to get reports from the chiefs of research, intelligence and logistics. Orders have already been submitted, it will take several hours for analysis. After that, it will be possible to plan further actions."
  STR_RND_STATUS_REPORT: "R&D Status Report"
  STR_RND_STATUS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Hello, Central... Oh, I'm sorry, I mean, hello, Commander! It seems that since Dr. Meyer's death, I'm in charge of the R&D department. Please don't look at my age, I have two PhDs in microbiology and high energy physics and I've been helping Dr. Meyer organize work last six months.{NEWLINE}Now to the point, if you'll let me. Ufopaedia is encrypted, and that's what's bothering me the most right now. Jim, the data analyst, says there's still hope! I suggest we begin decrypting immediately.{NEWLINE}Also, we need to interrogate the prisoners we're capturing, perhaps this will help shed some light on what's happening..."
  STR_INTEL_STATUS_REPORT: "Intelligence Report"
  STR_INTEL_STATUS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Oh, Commander! Recent events have tied our hands entirely, all secret government communication channels have been cut off, we will have to build our agent network from scratch. You can assign a couple of scientists to set up new encrypted communication channels. It is essential to set up covert operations conducted by our agents to gather intelligence assets.{NEWLINE}Additionally, we can establish secure contact with our remaining friends, I have a few people I've been watching for a long time. Their help will be invaluable in the given circumstances."
  STR_ENGINEER_STATUS_REPORT: "Engineer's Report"
  STR_ENGINEER_STATUS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Greetings, Commander! Our base was in a very poor condition even before the attack. Due to a lack of funding, we were forced to close several facilities and sell off some valuable equipment. After closing the workshop, our production capacity is at a minimum, we are trying to assemble spare parts from improvised materials. It is absolutely unclear where we will get the supplies from now, at least the most basic ones. Intelligence has forbidden my guys to leave the base, and from where will we get everything we need for maintaining, not to mention building modules? Maybe R&D folks would think about the secure source of the general supplies?"
  STR_VEHICLES_STATUS_REPORT: "Vehicles Status"
  STR_VEHICLES_STATUS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Our vehicles are repaired, refueled, and ready to use. It's just that we don't have radar anymore. The intelligence guys are constantly monitoring reports of UFOs' signs all over the globe, but the real chance of alien ship tracking is very poor. Although if we manage to do that, Stalker-1 is ready for takeoff. Hopefully, it will get luckier than Stalker-2, hit by a burst of plasma. We've got a good deal of ammo left, but we don't have a restocking source - Stingray missiles aren't for sale at the supermarket, you know. The Dragonfly-1 landing craft is ready for full deployment once the mission site located."
  STR_PRISONER_INTERROGATIONS: "Prisoner Interrogations"
  STR_PRISONER_INTERROGATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "I am proficient in many forms of interrogating suspects and believe that this is the most effective way to obtain crucial insights that will help shed light on unfolding events. While some suspects may not have any vital knowledge, I advise you to interrogate all our captives. In addition to strategic intelligence, this will help us determine specific combat features of our enemies and identify their strengths and vulnerabilities. Our prison can hold up to 10 human prisoners, but for more exotic creatures we will have to design suitable containment units according to their biology."
  STR_UFOPEDIA_DECRYPTION: "Ufopaedia decryption"
  STR_UFOPEDIA: "Ufopaedia"
  STR_UFOPEDIA_UFOPEDIA: "We managed to break through the primary protection of the blocked Ufopaedia archive! Sadly, once we had accessed the system, we found inner layers of data encryption. One section seems to hold all the technical data on the equipment we use. It won't be difficult to decipher that part. The other is much better protected and it seems that only the commander had access to it before the lockdown. I can't say for sure, but it most likely contains strategic data about the project history and its formation background. Perhaps the analysis of past events will allow us to avoid these errors in the future."

  STR_XCOM_EQUIPMENT_ARTICLE_HEADER: "X-Com Equipment"
  STR_XCOM_EQUIPMENT_UNLOCKED: "X-Com Equipment"
  STR_XCOM_EQUIPMENT_UFOPEDIA: "We gained access to the main sections of Ufopaedia, a database with tactical and technical information on XCOM equipment and hardware used, manufacturer's instructions, and service recommendations. It is unlikely that we would have been able to access this data so extensively from other sources, as we' ve been cut from support from the Council and world governments who probably do not know that we still exist. In any case, you can now clarify any information you are interested in in the relevant section of Ufopaedia, which is now accessible from your work computer."

  STR_COMMUNICATION: "Communication"
  STR_COMMUNICATION_UFOPEDIA: "Most of the old government communication channels are no longer available to us, the rest are probably controlled by alien agents. Centralized use of direct radio links, even if encrypted, is not reasonable either - our enemies will be able to track the source of the signals and destroy it. Fortunately, we live in an age of booming decentralized computer networks! By hacking hundreds of thousands of personal computers online, our IT specialists have deployed an entire system of sophisticated proxy servers. Our encrypted messages are embedded in massive data flows and mixed with a vast amount of false messages being sent. Meanwhile, any attempt to track or intercept our traffic will immediately be detected and the data will be securely rerouted to another path, potentially enveloping the entire planet."
  STR_BASE_DEFENSE_COMBAT_ANALYSIS: "Base defense tactical analysis"
  STR_BASE_DEFENSE_COMBAT_ANALYSIS_UFOPEDIA: "Tactical analysis of the recent assault on our base has exposed several significant security vulnerabilities. Despite the fact that most of the complex is underground, some of its modules have a direct connection to the surface. The obvious point of enemy penetration into the base is the entry lift. In addition, our aircraft perform vertical take-off from the hangars. Despite our attempts to disguise the closing casements of our hangars, they can still be easily detected from the ground. Enemies blasted a few holes in the casements and went down on ropes inside. There is a good chance that our enemies will use the hangars to break into the base in the future as well. Unfortunately, these circumstances were not taken into account in the initial base design, and now we need to think about how to improve the defense systems, and also to pay more attention to the base layout."
  STR_COVERT_OPERATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "Due to the clear dominance of our enemy, the preferred strategy will be keeping a low profile when dealing with important strategic tasks. We can send our agents to covert operations for more subtle methods of solving a problem than an aggressive attack. The secure channels we've developed allow us to coordinate agents remotely, and for some operations, it is also important to involve scientists for analytical work and engineers to design the special gear. A covert operation is always a risk, and in order to increase your success odds you should be careful when choosing your team and equipment, any little thing, in the end, can play a key role." 
  STR_RESISTANCE_CONTACT: "Contact with the Resistance"
  STR_RESISTANCE_CONTACT_UFOPEDIA: "The Resistance is a voluntary union of people not willing to obey the new world regime. This initiative began to emerge in the early '70s and in the beginning, consisted of ufologists and conspiracy theorists. Who could ever guess that they would be right? In the past few years, the Resistance began to be joined by a large number of very different people - scientists, journalists, doctors, ordinary people, and even former military officers. They all had one thing in common - they had somehow come into contact with the aliens and now Men in Black are hunting them down. Most of those who have discovered even a little about aliens after a very short time have disappeared under mysterious and often frightening circumstances. The rest learn to hide well and form guerrilla cells around the world. The goal of the Resistance is to unite and protect these disparate groups, reveal the mysterious plans of the aliens, and consolidate all mankind against an extraterrestrial threat."
  STR_SUPPLIES: "Supplies"
  STR_SUPPLIES_UFOPEDIA: "In the current circumstances, we must act as carefully as possible to avoid unnecessary attention to ourselves. Fortunately, in many aspects our base is autonomous - we have a source of drinking water and electricity generators. We have developed a system by which we can organize safe purchases of food and basic supplies, and some simple spare parts in several nearby cities. We've had major funding issues for a long time, so we're already left with people who put the fight against aliens ahead of taking care of their personal earnings. We've resigned contracts with all the staff, all of them willing to continue working on the project on a voluntary basis.  We just need to take care of providing them with everything they need to work, and it would be good to encourage them if possible."

  STR_LOYALTY_UFOPEDIA: "After the X-Com project was officially shut down, we can only count on ourselves, and our people decided to fight for the idea of insubordination to the alien invaders. The spirit of the X-Com team today is more important than ever and it is essential not to let the morale go down. There are many things that can influence the morale of our men - the accomplishments in battles against the aliens and their servants and the achievement of objectives, major scientific breakthroughs, and progress towards understanding the nature of our enemies, as well as strategic choices. A cohesive team can help us through many challenges, but a loss of trust can put an end to everything."
