#cutscenes
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE1_CAPTION: "The Council of Funding Nations is closing the X-Com project and terminating of all its activities. Perhaps this has something to do with the recent changes of Council membership, with several Council members facing clearly fabricated charges. Agents of a top secret intergovernmental organization known to us as the Men in Black have been assigned to the Council as exclusive security force. We are confident that the purpose of this organization extends far beyond the protection services - there are reasons to suspect them of aiding the aliens, and it seems that they are trying to cover up any traces of their activity."
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE2_CAPTION: "The Commander of X-Com has been called to the Council to receive the final instructions. Two days later, he returned to the base accompanied by MiB agents and initiated the 'Oblivion' protocol: an irreversible encryption of the Ufopedia (X-Com's archive of scientific and technological achievements), decreed dismissal of all personnel and issued orders to dismantle the base facilities."
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE3_CAPTION: "All colleagues noticed some peculiar changes in his behavior - communication became more drastic and formal, and there was a steep decrease of empathy. We have already documented such personality changes of some of our field agents, and we assume that this indicates some form of external mind control. You know the Commander well, he would never so easily destroy what we have been working so hard all these years!"
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE4_CAPTION: "Dr. Meyer, chief of the research department, tried to prevent the loss of research data. Unfortunately, he was not a trained spy and was caught trying to back up the Ufopedia. An MiB agent shot him on sight, and the Commander didn't even blink!"
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE5_CAPTION: "There are still people who are loyal to fighting the alien invasion. To arms!"

  STR_INTRODUCTION: "Commander log #001"
  STR_INTRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "As senior officer, I took command. I hope my experience is enough to cope with the situation.{NEWLINE}The alien agents seem to be retreating, looks like we've been able to defend our base, at least for a while... Apparently, this and other operations in the region are being managed from a kind of regional center disguised as an administrative building. We've got external surveillance, preliminary data shows that the facility is substantially secured. A sudden attack can seriously confuse our opponents' plans and could probably slow down their progress. An assault plot must be carefully designed.{NEWLINE}In the meantime, it is necessary to gather status reports on the core units and understand what we still have to go. We need to get reports from the chiefs of research, intelligence and logistics. Orders have already been submitted, it will take several hours for analysis. After that, it will be possible to plan further actions."
  STR_RND_STATUS_REPORT: "R&D Status Report"
  STR_RND_STATUS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Hello, Central... Oh, I'm sorry, I mean, hello, Commander! It seems that since Dr. Meyer's death, I'm in charge of the R&D department. Please don't look at my age, I have two PhDs in microbiology and high energy physics and I've been helping Dr. Meyer organize work last six months.{NEWLINE}Now to the point, if you'll let me. Ufopedia is encrypted, and that's what's bothering me the most right now. Jim, the data analyst, says there's still hope! I suggest we begin decrypting immediately.{NEWLINE}Also, we need to interrogate the prisoners we're capturing, perhaps this will help shed some light on what's happening..."
