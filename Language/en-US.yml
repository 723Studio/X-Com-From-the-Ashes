  STR_DAMAGE_ARMOR_PIERCING_TOPIC: "Kinetic Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_ARMOR_PIERCING_UFOPEDIA: "Weapons dealing kinetic damage are one of the most reliable and common types of weapons we use. This type of damage is inflicted by accelerating the projectile to a high speed (e.g., by the pressure of expanding propellant gases). It can cause bleeding on impact and the resulting damage reduces the target's combat ability. Because of the widespread use of this type of weapons various means to protect from them are just as common.  Some types of weapons have a certain armor penetration rate, which depends mainly on the type of the projectile and its speed.{NEWLINE}Additionally, based on previous unfortunate encounters with aliens, we can assume that they have very effective ways of mitigating kinetic damage."
  STR_DAMAGE_INCENDIARY_TOPIC: "Incendiary Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_INCENDIARY_UFOPEDIA: "Incendiary weaponry is often brought into action to deny chokepoints or when standard ordinance is ineffective. A target set ablaze will take a small but not insignificant amount of damage over time for a while, which is only regulated by the target's flame resistance rather than armor values too - after all, the only difference between being cooked and charred alive is that in case of the former the remains can end up slightly less scorched. Fire damage will also, understandably, make the target lose more morale than most other damage types. Furthermore, enemies with at least a semblance of self-preservation instincts will avoid crossing burning areas unless absolutely necessary."
  STR_DAMAGE_HIGH_EXPLOSIVE_TOPIC: "High Explosive Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_HIGH_EXPLOSIVE_UFOPEDIA: "Explosives are a tried and proven way of erasing obstacles to access new routes, as well as hostiles, should there be too many of them to take out one by one. Or, when there isn't a good opportunity to target them otherwise in the first place. Explosives can also prove invaluable when dealing with highly armored opponents and vehicles, especially the ones specifically designed for that purpose. Care and restraint should be exercised when using explosives, as a misplaced bomb can prove more detrimental to the user(s) than the designated target."

  STR_DAMAGE_PLASMA_BEAM_UFOPEDIA: STR_DAMAGE_PLASMA_BEAM_UFOPEDIA #FIXME
  STR_DAMAGE_STUN_TOPIC: "Stun Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_STUN_UFOPEDIA: "Although killing an enemy is usually the easiest way to win in terms of tactics, sometimes capturing the enemy alive is worth the extra effort. Some enemies may have critical information for us, and we need to interrogate them to move forward in unraveling the aliens' plans. Stunning an enemy will incapacitate them for several turns. If we manage to disable all other enemies or get the stunned unit to our craft and leave the battlefield before it wakes up, it will be taken to the base and placed in our containment facility."
  STR_DAMAGE_MELEE_TOPIC: "Cutting Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_MELEE_UFOPEDIA: "Melee weapons are among the simplest yet still effective types of weapons, if one's opponents aren't armored. At close range it might be preferable to dispatch an enemy by means of a combat knife or a similar implement given how quick they are to use, especially if the hostiles are the ones approaching. However, using it in other circumstances is inadvisable - risking overextension for an attack that might end up failing is always a bad decision but wanting to engage in melee combat can lead to the worst results should any complications arise. It's also relatively easy to be protected from cutting weapons; that goes either way."
  STR_DAMAGE_ACID_TOPIC: "Chemical Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_ACID_UFOPEDIA: "Most of the damage chemical weapons inflict is due to aggressive substances - acids or bases applied to the enemy's body. Chemicals can have a pronounced corrosive effect on enemy armor, as well as cause severe chemical burns to the skin, sometimes incompatible with life. The fumes produced by the reaction can be toxic and damage the respiratory tract if inhaled. The enemies may spend part of their turn trying to shake off the compound."
  STR_DAMAGE_SMOKE_TOPIC: "Choke Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_SMOKE_UFOPEDIA: "Smoke can provide a helpful, if intangible, cover from enemy fire. It can also become a hazard - inhaling smoke from any source will eventually result in loss of consciousness from oxygen deprivation. It can be used to facilitate captures but overstaying in smoke could lead to a shock not unlike the one caused by abuse of stun weaponry. Thus it's ill-advised for wounded troops to stay long - or in worst cases at all - in smokescreens, grenade-made or otherwise."
  STR_DAMAGE_EMP_TOPIC: "EMP Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_EMP_UFOPEDIA: STR_DAMAGE_EMP_UFOPEDIA #FIXME
  STR_DAMAGE_ELECTRIC_TOPIC: "Electric Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_ELECTRIC_UFOPEDIA: "An electric shock is caused when a person is exposed to and/or comes into contact with a source of electricity, thus sending an electrical current through a portion of the person's body. A common person can perceive a passing alternating or direct current greater than 1 or 5 mA respectively. In addition, at high-voltage installations one can experience an electric shock without touching live parts as a result of an air breakdown with the formation of an electric arc. As a result of an electric shock, the target will experience convulsions and loss of consciousness; a high-power shock can result in death."

  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE1_CAPTION: "The Council of Funding Nations has decided to terminate the X-COM project and all its activities.

Agents of a top secret supragovernmental organization known to us as the Men in Black have been assigned to the Council as the exclusive security force. We are confident that the purpose of this organization extends far beyond the protection services - there are reasons to suspect them of aiding the aliens, and they are trying to cover up any traces of their activity."

  STR_RESISTANCE_CELL_CREATION: "Creating a Resistance Cell"
  STR_RESISTANCE_CELL_CREATION_DESCRIPTION: "We need to help the Resistance establish a new cell in the vicinity of M.I.B. headquarters. Despite the great risk, this could greatly help us in preparing for the coming assault."
  STR_RESISTANCE_CELL_CREATION_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION: "Resistance agents managed to set up a new cell near the M.I.B. headquarters. Now we can count on their support."
  STR_RESISTANCE_CELL_CREATION_FAILURE_DESCRIPTION: "We failed to organize a new Resistance cell close to the M.I.B. headquarters. We were to meet at the safe house, but as we approached it, we noticed a conventional sign. A flower on the windowsill signifying danger, a complete failure of the operation. Apparently, one of the Resistance agents had managed to put it up before the Men in Black raided the place."
  STR_EX_COUNCIL_DATA_VAULT_EXTRACTION: "Data Vault Recovery"
  STR_EX_COUNCIL_DATA_VAULT_EXTRACTION_DESCRIPTION: "Based on the data provided by the ex-Council member, we can investigate the theft of the Data Vault and endeavor to track down the thieves. This is a very delicate task, and we must be extremely careful not to draw unnecessary attention."

  STR_EX_COUNCIL_DATA_VAULT_CONVEY_DESCRIPTION: "Now that we have the Data Vault, we need to stealthily deliver it to the agreed location.

  STR_CULT_INVESTIGATION: "Cult Investigation"
  STR_CULT_INVESTIGATION_DESCRIPTION: "We need to investigate the mysterious kidnapping incidents. We must begin by analyzing the results of the local police investigation, for which our agents will have to pretend to be representatives of the national bureau of investigation. As a result of the investigation we expect to reach the suspects, we need to be prepared for encounter. In this case, it would be reasonable to attempt arrest and interrogate them."
  STR_STEAL_OSPREY_OPERATION: "Steal Osprey"
  STR_STEAL_OSPREY_OPERATION_DESCRIPTION: "Our agents will disguise themselves as personnel servicing decommissioned equipment.

  STR_INFILTRATING_MILITARY_RND_DESCRIPTION: "We have developed a plan to infiltrate a secret military R&D facility that designs the latest weapons and equipment for the army. This technology could prove indispensable in our fight against alien invasion. By bribing officials we plan to infiltrate the base in the guise of workers and sneak through the elevator shaft. It's prudent to use concealed and silent weapons, the sounds of gunfire can raise the alarm on the base. Non-lethal weapons are recommended, as killing innocent guards who happen to be the victims of our raid could end up hurting the morale of our men."
  STR_INFILTRATING_MILITARY_RND_FAILURE_DESCRIPTION: "The contact who was supposed to bring our soldiers to the military RnD facility betrayed us by alerting the guards at the base. Our soldiers had to flee the pursuit and fight off the military."
  STR_MONSTER_HUNT_INVESTIGATION: "Monster Activity Investigation"
  STR_MONSTER_HUNT_INVESTIGATION_DESCRIPTION: "On this operation, our soldiers will work under the guise of federal agents investigating attacks by mysterious monsters.

  STR_MONSTER_HUNT_START_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "We constantly receive information about encounters with strange creatures. X-COM has previously investigated such cases, but we have been unable to achieve meaningful results. It is likely that if we continue our research, we will be able to draw a more holistic picture of what is happening with these mysterious monsters. However, given our current state of affairs, perhaps it makes sense to focus on the survival of the project instead of wasting energy on unconfirmed rumors."

What is the nature of their origin, numbers, diversity and regions of habitation - these are questions we have yet to answer. For now, the only thing that is clear is that we need to continue to study these beings. We should capture and examine the living specimen carefully, and a new base unit should be developed to keep the monsters safely at the base."

  STR_NOT_RESCUED_SCIENTIST_DESCRIPTION: "We have failed to rescue the stranded scientist. The invaders' forces were far too numerous for us to handle.

  STR_MISTERY_CULT_EVENT: "Mysterious Cult"
  STR_MISTERY_CULT_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "Mysterious murders are being reported from all over the world. Obviously, all of them could not have been committed by the same person.

  STR_ELECTRIC_WEAPONS_PREREQ_EVENT: "Electric Weapons"
  STR_ELECTRIC_WEAPONS_PREREQ_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "Given our serious lack of data on the adversary, it makes sense for us to try to capture enemy units alive if possible. It is likely that by interrogating our enemies we will be able to learn the most valuable strategic information. One of the most effective ways to render a living creature unconscious is to shock it with a strong electric shock.

The last thing he remembers is how he left the house at night when he saw a strange glow in his cornfield. This happened in July 1996. Judging by his constitution, reaction and combat training, it's hard to believe that we're looking at a simple farmer. It'd be easier to believe he's an elite special agent but, as far as we can tell, his story seems genuine. Unfortunately, all attempts to get more information led to nothing."

  STR_MIB_SPECOPS_UFOPEDIA: "This elite soldier has excellent physical attributes and tactical training. His equipment uses the latest scientific achievements in the field of armor materials and optical systems. Unfortunately, the suit has a safety mechanism that rendered it unusable. The soldier remembers nothing about what happened to him before the operation we managed to capture him.

  STR_MIB_BUTCHER_UFOPEDIA: "It is hard to believe that such incredible muscle mass can be gained through normal exercise and diet. These operatives have inhuman strength, health and stamina and are especially dangerous in close combat. A study of DNA samples revealed mutations in the genes encoding the production of myostatin, a protein that inhibits the growth and differentiation of muscle tissue. The nature of this mutation remains unclear, but the other mutations perfectly maintain the stability and organicity of the individual."
  STR_MIB_BUTCHER_ARMOR: "M.I.B. Butcher Combat Analysis"

Their primary mission is to destroy anyone who gains unauthorized access to the facility. Rarely they are used in punitive operations where high firepower is required. The subject has undergone a massive psychological conditioning - his personality is almost completely erased, leaving only weapon skills, polished to an instinctive level, as well as absolute loyalty to his masters. An example of human transformation into a perfect war machine."

The drone has high speed and maneuverability, with peripheral visual and thermal sensors that allow it to easily identify the enemy. Its energy weapons are certainly of great interest for further study."
  STR_SEEKER_DRONE_CORPSE_UFOPEDIA: "It is difficult to identify the manufacturer of this drone from the remaining wreckage. Apparently, it was equipped with some sort of self-destruct device. All the electronics were almost completely scorched out, with only ash left of the central computing units. Only the wiring and weapons control system were partially intact. The weapon itself is some kind of powerful energy emitter. Alas, the high degree of damage prevents any hope of reverse engineering."

He refuses to communicate and shows aggression at every opportunity. All of our interrogation methods have proven ineffective and the method aliens use to maintain control is still unclear to us. During the physical examination there were no signs of any surgical intervention, with all medical tests within the normal range (except for adrenaline).

  STR_MIB_OFFICE_SECURITY_UFOPEDIA: "Hired through a private security organization, this security officer does not have any valuable information. He did not have access to many areas of the office (apparently, all the ones used by M.I.B.). He once saw a black truck pull into the garage and thought he saw someone inside calling for help. Internal security officers (obviously M.I.B. agents) convinced him that he was mistaken."

He was convinced that it was a top-secret government organization, they had managed to bribe and intimidate him, so the banker did not ask too many questions.

Growing up, he joined a gang, was involved in robbery, extortion, and did various errands for his bosses. Lately, he's been getting jobs involving contract murders and kidnappings more often. However, he is barely paid for this orders, and he is afraid to argue with the gang bosses or leave."

  STR_CULT_COORDINATOR_CORPSE: "Cult Coordinator Corpse"
  STR_CULT_COORDINATOR_UFOPEDIA: "Having interrogated the bandit coordinator, we learned something interesting and unusual about their gang. In the past they were mainly involved in drug trafficking and smuggling, as well as fighting over territory with neighboring gangs. However, since recently, everything has changed very drastically - all the heads of the gangs known to him gradually united and stopped feuding, the usual types of earnings have moved into the background. Now very often the rank-and-file gang members are involved in kidnapping people, as he thinks - for a ransom. At the same time, he has never heard of anyone being released. All the prisoners are taken to the gang headquarters, and from there they are taken by people he does not know."
  STR_CULT_COORDINATOR_ARMOR: "Cult Coordinator Combat Analysis"

  STR_FACEHUGGER: "Facehugger"
  STR_FACEHUGGER_UFOPEDIA: "This rubbish jumps on a victim, using its stinger to inject the parasite with a neuroparalytic poison. The parasite quickly makes its way through the body and attaches itself to the brain of the host with its flagella. The parasite completely controls the signals sent to the spinal cord, artificially keeping the person alive. At the moment of application of the parasite, it is still connected for some time with the facehugger, but before the latter breaks apart it is restrained by cramps, and because of the physical strain it has a ruptured heart and dies, letting the victim go. The details of this terrible process are still not clear to us."
  STR_FACEHUGGER_CORPSE: "Facehugger corpse"
  STR_FACEHUGGER_AUTOPSY: "Facehugger Autopsy"
  STR_FACEHUGGER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This creature's circulation is closed, and it breathes through the contraction of a single lung.  It is completely incomprehensible how it feeds and reproduces its own kind. Its tail has a terrifying sting, joined to a system of intricate glands. The contents of the sac is a separate organism, connected to its host by a network of thick nerve tubes. Unfortunately, the contents of the sac have been damaged and almost nothing is left of the parasite, as it decomposes extremely quickly in the air environment."
  STR_FACEHUGGER_ARMOR: "Facehugger Combat Analysis"
  STR_FACEHUGGER_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "The only defense of this creature is its agility and size, and the main task is to get close to the victim and make a jump. The creature grasps the victim's head and pokes its stinger into his chest, zombifying the person. Once zombification complete, the facehugger dies."
  STR_FRESH_ZOMBIE: "Zombie"
  STR_ZOMBIE_STERILE_UFOPEDIA: "Once in the past it was a man, but now it is extremely difficult to call him a human. It is striking that this creature gives out almost everything - a terrible smell from the rotting of a dead body, incoherent sounds and clumsy movements. A parasite sits inside the body, which has disabled all organism systems and controls movement. If you destroy the parasite, the body will be just a piece of meat. It decomposes quickly, because the blood has long been oxidized and the organs do not keep the body in proper condition. Motility and immunity are absent."
  STR_FRESH_ZOMBIE_CORPSE: "Zombie corpse"
  STR_ZOMBIE_STERILE_AUTOPSY: "Zombie Autopsy"
  STR_ZOMBIE_STERILE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The parasite was extracted from the zombie. It is clear that the body is dead and decomposes quickly, a large number of microorganisms were found inside that feed on dead flesh. Due to the lack of motility and immunity, some organs and systems of the body have stumbled so much that they very remotely resemble their original."
  STR_FRESH_ZOMBIE_ARMOR: "Zombie Combat Analysis"
  STR_FRESH_ZOMBIE_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "Zombies are dangerous only at close range. They have no tactics, are slow, disorganized, and usually pile up in droves. Zombie are completely immune to pain, and their bodies are controlled not by their brains, but by a parasite entrenched in their chests. The lack of armor makes slashing weapons and buckshot especially effective."
  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_TERRORIST: "Fat Zombie"
  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_UFOPEDIA: "The reaction of the body to the poison that was injected by the parasite caused a strong transformation of the body. As a result, the whole body was swollen and overgrown with fat. The muscles were also covered with fat, which now created a monster with great physical strength. Due to the abundance of flesh and fat, this specimen can take many shots. It is recommended to use a large caliber when seeing this organism in battle."
  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_CORPSE: "Fat Zombie corpse"
  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_AUTOPSY: "Fat Zombie Autopsy"
  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This zombie's body is filled with fat inside and out, its organs are much larger than normal, and there are signs of necrosis and putrefaction all over its body. Because of its great physical strength and enormous body size, it needs a lot of food to maintain its energy balance. The parasite was extracted and successfully removed."
  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_ARMOR: "Fat Zombie Combat Analysis"
  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "Fat zombies are clumsy, but very strong and survivable foes. They don't have any armor, but single small-caliber bullets can simply get stuck in thick layers of fat without causing significant damage to bones or internal organs. Only massive burst damage can bring down such a monster."
  STR_CHUPACABRA: "Chupacabra"
  STR_CHUPACABRA_CORPSE: "Chupacabra Corpse"
  STR_CHUPACABRA_UFOPEDIA: "An incredibly efficient predator, perfectly adapted to hunting in the woods and hilly prairies. Its powerful hind paws allow it to achieve tremendous speed in its spurt, and its front paws with razor-sharp claws leave its victim not the slightest chance. Moreover, its great reflexes and chitinous body spikes provide a good defense in a fight with almost any terrestrial animal."
  STR_CHUPACABRA_AUTOPSY: "Chupacabra Autopsy"
  STR_CHUPACABRA_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "In the structure of the skull and some skeletal features, this creature is similar to the canine group of animals. However, the unfolded pelvis, long hind limbs and the development of forelegs indicate adaptation to straight walking. This is a non-mammalian species, which reproduces by laying eggs. Surprisingly, it has green blood, which for terrestrial animals is very rare and not found in warm-blooded animals."
  STR_CHUPACABRA_ARMOR: "Chupacabra Combat Analysis"
  STR_CHUPACABRA_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "A ferocious and swift predator that uses both teeth and claws as well as chitinous spines in combat. It has an excellent sensitivity and orientates itself well in the dark. Its skin does not offer any special protective qualities."
  STR_ARMADILLO: "Armadillo"
  STR_ARMADILLO_CORPSE: "Armadillo Corpse"
  STR_ARMADILLO_UFOPEDIA: "It is an extremely strong and hardy creature, with a very good protection system due to its structure. Adapting to uprightness is far from complete, it moves clumsily and hunched over, often helping itself with its arms when running. In close combat, it uses its forelegs with razor-sharp claws and a powerful jaw with massive fangs. In case of danger, it crouches on the ground and puts forward a strong carapace. It is unclear how these creatures reproduce, and the result of DNA deciphering suggests intensive artificial gene modifications being carried out on this species."
  STR_ARMADILLO_AUTOPSY: "Armadillo Autopsy"
  STR_ARMADILLO_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "An anthropomorphic creature resembling an armadillo shocked our scientists. The skeletal structure, muscular and circulatory systems are striking, although adaptation to uprightness is far from complete. The most noticeable feature is the convex, incredibly strong shell on the back, to which the spine is attached. It forms a rather large cavity, causing all the vital organs to shift further away from the ribs, and the space freed is used to form something like a fibrous subcutaneous body armor. The creature's skin is covered with small, extremely tough, sand-colored scales."
  STR_ARMADILLO_ARMOR: "Armadillo Combat Analysis"
  STR_ARMADILLO_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "The armadillo has excellent natural resistance to a wide variety of kinds of damage. It is savage and dangerous in melee combat. Fortunately, it is rather bumbling when moving around."

The eyes can work independently so the creature can see reasonably well unless all of them are damaged. Their stinger is very robust; it has difficulties penetrating heavy armor directly, but they instinctively seek out weak spots, leaving pheromones as a signal to the rest of the swarm. Conventional projectile-based weapons are of little use, only explosions and especially fire can damage them consistently."
  STR_SWARMIDS_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The body of this insectoid creature comprises a slightly armored torso and a flexible tail. The torso hosts a slot containing multiple articulated eyes and is surmounted by three pairs of wings. The tail is wholly muscle tissue, similar to the human tongue, and it ends with a fearsome stinger used for attacking prey."
  STR_SWARMIDS_SMALL_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: A swarm of aggressive insects poses a serious danger to our soldiers. The carnivorous flies penetrate into the smallest crevices of almost any armor. At the same time, the swarm itself is virtually immune to firearms and melee attacks.

  STR_AMPHIBIAN_CORPSE: "Amphibian Corpse"
  STR_AMPHIBIAN_UFOPEDIA: "The creature is clearly amphibious, looking like a hybrid of a different species of frogs and a gorilla. It is capable of spitting venom and inherits from the gorilla its powerful body, fury, and sharp teeth.Apparently, these creatures hunt large mammals, paralyze their prey with poison, and drag it into the water, where it will suffer a painful death by drowning while its helpless body is torn apart. The creatures lay their eggs directly in the under-eaten remains of their victims, to provide their offspring with nutrition immediately after hatching."
  STR_AMPHIBIAN_AUTOPSY: "Amphibian Autopsy"
  STR_AMPHIBIAN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "In the structure of its head and torso with its internal organs, this creature is most similar to a frog, while its forelimbs, hind limbs, and the structure of the shoulder complex rather refer to primates, such as the gorilla. An important feature is the presence of many massive glands that secrete a strong neuroparalytic toxin, and the structure of the pharynx allows this monster to spit venom over long distances. Apparently, the hybrid is capable of changing sex when necessary, which ensures the good survivability of this species."
  STR_AMPHIBIAN_ARMOR: "Amphibian Combat Analysis"
  STR_AMPHIBIAN_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "Although this creature lacks any meaningful natural defense against firearms, its ability to spit neuroparalytic venom makes it a significant threat on the battlefield. Because of its large size and impressive muscle mass, weapons with high power are recommended."

The density and other physical properties of the alloy of which it is composed are very heterogeneous, the most of it is very strong, much stronger than titanium. It appears that the device is hollow inside.  Device emits beta particles, and the intensity is cyclic and pulsating. Interestingly, the body alloy changes its ferromagnetic properties abruptly in opposition to the radiation. We tried to cut it open, which was extremely difficult. The inner cavity was filled with gas at very low pressure, on contact with air the gas began to rapidly decompose, which was accompanied by the formation of antimatter, which instantly annihilated.

Due to lack of funding, we were forced to close several facilities and sell off valuable equipment. Since the workshop was closed, our production capacity is at a minimum, and we are trying to assemble spare parts from the materials at hand. It is obvious that with our current facilities we are not able to produce combat weapons. However, my guys are trying to adapt any available corner of the base to accommodate at least simple machines. Our engineers are extremely talented and can assemble anything from complete junk!

The intelligence guys are constantly monitoring reports of UFOs' signs all over the globe, but the real chance of alien ship tracking is very poor. Although if we manage to do that, Stalker-1 is ready for takeoff. Hopefully, it will get luckier than Stalker-2, hit by a burst of plasma. We've got a good deal of ammo left, but we don't have a restocking source - Stingray missiles aren't for sale at the supermarket, you know.

While some suspects may not have any vital knowledge, I advise you to interrogate all our captives. In addition to strategic intelligence, this will help us determine specific combat features of our enemies and identify their strengths and vulnerabilities.

One section seems to hold all the technical data on the equipment we use. It won't be difficult to decipher that part. The other is much better protected, and it seems that only the commander had access to it before the lockdown. I can't say for sure, but it most likely contains strategic data about the project history and its formation background.

Centralized use of direct radio links, even if encrypted, is not reasonable either - our enemies will be able to track the source of the signals and destroy it. Fortunately, we live in an age of booming decentralized computer networks! By hacking hundreds of thousands of personal computers online, our IT specialists have deployed an entire system of sophisticated proxy servers. Our encrypted messages are embedded in massive data flows and mixed with a vast amount of false messages being sent.

  STR_BASE_DEFENSE_COMBAT_ANALYSIS: "Base Defense Tactical Analysis"
  STR_BASE_DEFENSE_COMBAT_ANALYSIS_UFOPEDIA: "Tactical analysis of the recent assault on our base has exposed several significant security vulnerabilities. Although most of the complex is underground, some of its modules have a direct connection to the surface. The obvious point of enemy penetration into the base is the entry lift. In addition, our aircraft perform vertical take-off from the hangars. Despite our attempts to disguise the closing casements of our hangars they can still be easily detected from the ground. Enemies blasted a few holes in the casements and went down on ropes inside. There is a good chance that our enemies will use the hangars to break into the base in the future as well. Unfortunately, these circumstances were not taken into account in the initial base design, and now we need to think about how to improve the defense systems, and also to pay more attention to the base layout."
  STR_COVERT_OPERATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "Due to the clear dominance of our enemy, the preferred strategy will be keeping a low profile when dealing with important strategic tasks. We can send our agents to covert operations for more subtle methods of solving a problem than an open attack. The secure channels we've developed allow us to coordinate agents remotely, and for some operations, it is also important to involve scientists for analytical work and engineers to design the special gear. A covert operation is always a risk, and in order to increase your success odds you should be careful when choosing your team and equipment. Any little thing, in the end, can play a key role." 
  STR_MONSTER_HUNT_START: "Strange creatures"
  STR_MONSTER_HUNT_START_UFOPEDIA: "We have collected cross-referenced data pointing to paranormal phenomena localized in the forests of northern Illinois, USA. Cases of mysterious disappearances of people and domestic animals have been reported in this region. Local authorities have investigated cases and even involved the FBI, but as far as we know, these actions have not yielded significant results. Our soldiers can pretend to be federal agents conducting another investigation to avoid attracting attention."

  STR_MONSTER_HUNT_RUMORS_UFOPEDIA: "We managed to expand the number of information channels through which we receive information concerning the activity of unknown monsters that are contacting civilians. Based on machine learning algorithms, a huge amount of various information is analyzed, and we are able to get timely information about the location of a new incident. Thus, we will be able to send a squad of our agents there and conduct a 'hot pursuit' investigation, and ideally - try to capture one of those creatures for further study.

This initiative began to emerge in the early '70s and in the beginning, consisted of ufologists and conspiracy theorists. Who could ever guess that they would be in the right? In the past few years, the Resistance began to be joined by a large number of very different people - scientists, journalists, doctors, ordinary people, and even former military officers. They all had one thing in common - they had somehow come into contact with the aliens and now Men in Black are hunting them down. Most of those who have discovered even a little about the aliens after a very short time have disappeared under mysterious and often frightening circumstances. The rest learn to hide well and form guerrilla cells around the world.

But we continue to fight, and we vitally need new sources of weaponry and ammunition. Maybe our new friends can help out with that? Regrettably, lacking established illegal arms channels, they can only offer us weapons that are available for purchase by civilians. Our contact in the Resistance transferred the tactical specifications of the items we can buy from them, all information analyzed and uploaded to Ufopedia."
  STR_SUPPLIES: "Supplies"
  STR_SUPPLIES_UFOPEDIA: "In the current circumstances we must act as carefully as possible to avoid unnecessary attention to ourselves. Fortunately, in many aspects our base is autonomous - we have a source of drinking water and electricity generators. We have developed a system by which we can organize safe purchases of food and basic supplies, and some simple spare parts in several nearby cities. We've had major funding issues for a long time, so we're already left with people who put the fight against aliens ahead of taking care of their personal earnings. We've resigned contracts with all the staff, all of them willing to continue working on the project voluntarily, as long as we take care of providing them with everything they need to work, and it would be good to keep the morale high."
  STR_LOYALTY: "Loyalty"
  STR_LOYALTY_UFOPEDIA: "The X-COM Project was officially shut down and now we can only count on ourselves. The loss of the Council’s support is a severe blow to our organization but despite all hard circumstances our people are determined to fight against alien invaders at all costs. 'Ad victoriam' - that’s our new motto! Today isn’t money determining our future, but how strong our men’s spirit is. It is essential not to let the morale go down and there are many points of influence on it. The successful operations against our adversaries, major scientific and technological breakthroughs, and progress towards understanding the nature of our enemies, - all these factors will significantly raise the morale and bring the team together, that’s why we should be extremely careful and wise in our strategic and tactical choices."

  STR_EX_COUNCIL_MEMBER_INITIAL_UFOPEDIA: "Greetings, Commander. I am incredibly pleased that the X-Com project has survived the recent tragic events and hope that you are able to continue the fight against the alien invasion. Until recently, I was a member of the Council of Funding Nations and was an adamant supporter of the project for a long time. I believe alien agents have infiltrated the Council itself, which should explain the radical change of its activities. I need your help to investigate these insidious intrigues. I will transmit the details of the mission through a secure channel."
  STR_RESISTANCE_STARTING_EQUIPMENT: "Resistance Equipment"
  STR_RESISTANCE_STARTING_EQUIPMENT_UFOPEDIA: "Establishing ties with the Resistance has paid off - now we can buy from them some weapons and equipment for our needs! Of course, these guys would be happy to help us completely free of charge, but it should be understood that it’s not so easy to get anything, so we must compensate some associated costs with proportional amount of money. Of course, the equipment we are purchasing is far from cutting-edge technology, but at least it will allow us to maintain the average combat capability of our agents and be ready to conduct various operations."
  STR_RESISTANCE_BASIC_EQUIPMENT: "Resistance Military Equipment"
  STR_RESISTANCE_BASIC_EQUIPMENT_UFOPEDIA: "Now the Resistance is ready to secretly supply us with military-grade weapons and equipment. We should maintain good relations with them, it is unlikely that they will sell guns to foes. It is also possible that they will want to keep some items for themselves. We will have to prove that we are their allies before the Resistance will share the best they have with us."

  STR_EXPANDABLE_AMMO: "Expansive Ammunition"
  STR_EXPANDABLE_AMMO_UFOPEDIA: "Expansive bullets are designed to significantly increase their diameter when hitting soft tissue in order to increase their lethality. This is achieved by increasing the softness of the metal from which the bullet is made, as well as the cavity at the apex. At the same time, this makes it significantly less effective against even lightly armored targets.{NEWLINE}Such ammunition is forbidden for use by the military and is used mainly for hunting, so it was not part of the standard X-COM ammunition."
  STR_ELECTRIC_WEAPONS: "Electric Weapons"
  STR_ELECTRIC_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "The production of effective electric weapons is a rather labor-intensive and high-tech process.

In contact with oxygen, it decomposes quite quickly into very toxic components, each aggressive to various types of surfaces, to which the composition lands. This results in an extremely effective weapon with a wide range of applications. The structural properties of this acid molecule are striking in their elegance. It is not easy to synthesize it, but our scientists have managed to develop a fairly straightforward process so that production can begin."

Unfortunately, some of them had to be dismantled last year, and some had never been built. Since we have figured out how to get basic construction materials, we can start the construction work if necessary and if we have money to buy everything we need. Of course, it will take some time to remove soil, reinforce walls and ceilings, and install internal equipment. In addition, most of the specialized facilities require special equipment, and we will have to figure out how to get it."

  STR_XCOM_FILES_1_UFOPEDIA: "UFOs have been the subject of governmental attention since the late 1940s. Until then, such incidents were not investigated because of the war, and before that the military did not have a sufficiently reliable way of detecting flying objects. The conditions of the Cold War, namely the active scanning of NATO and Soviet airspace, the development of detection technology and mutual mistrust actively contributed to the investigation of UFO activity in different countries.{NEWLINE}In 1984, an unsuccessful endeavor was made to create a secret intergovernmental committee at the UN, designed to unite the efforts of different countries. In 1996 a second attempt was made to create a supranational secret organization dedicated to investigating alien activity on Earth, called X-COM. Funding was supposed to come from a covert group of influential politicians and military officers from various countries named The Council.{NEWLINE}*** New entry ***{NEWLINE}On March 5, 1999, X-COM was disbanded.{NEWLINE}*** Confirm saving a new entry? (Y/N)"
  STR_XCOM_FILES_2: "X-COM FILES #096231"
  STR_XCOM_FILES_2_UFOPEDIA: "Disagreements within the Council regarding X-COM began about a year ago. Many were dissatisfied with the lack of practical results. For 4 years X-COM did not come close to understanding the objectives and motivations of the aliens, the peculiarities of their biology and technologies. In all that time, not once did it manage to shoot down an alien vessel. Twice a group of soldiers was dispatched to a UFO landing site, but both times contact with the squad broke off a few minutes after disembarkation. The soldiers relayed that they had made contact with the enemy, suffering casualties from some sort of energy weapon. The alien armor and some sort of force shields proved extremely effective against standard weapons. Because of the former commander's poor performance and controversial decisions, several members resigned from the council. Four more were forced to leave because they were hiding from the criminal prosecution conducted by Interpol."

  STR_RECORD_WOW_SIGNAL_UFOPEDIA: "Strong narrowband radio signal received on August 15, 1977 by Ohio State University's radio telescope, appeared to come from the constellation Sagittarius and bore the expected hallmarks of extraterrestrial origin. Astronomer Jerry Ehman was so impressed by the result that he circled the reading on printout and wrote the comment Wow! According to eyewitnesses, next day he was visited by two people who introduced themselves as federal agents. They insistently asked the scientist to go with them, and at night all the recordings on the signal disappeared from his office. Of the witnesses, there was only a photograph of the decrypted record, taken by a graduate student of Ehman."
  STR_CULT_ACTIVITY: "Cult Activity"
  STR_CULT_INVESTIGATION_UFOPEDIA: "Over the past 15 years cases of mysterious murders have been documented all over the world - slashed, exsanguinated bodies found in forests, ditches, and garbage dumps. The only connection between the victims was the intricate pattern of cuts on the bodies. We suspect that some mysterious cult is behind this.{NEWLINE}Interestingly, the dynamics of murder intensity is cyclical, with peaks coinciding with an increase in neurological disorder complaints and the admission of new patients to mental hospitals. Common symptoms are acute schizophrenia, hallucinations and panic attacks."
  STR_CROP_CIRCLES: "Crop Circles"
  STR_CROP_CIRCLES_UFOPEDIA: "We have analyzed the records in the Ufopedia Archive related to the reports of crop circles. The evidence is extremely confusing and contradictory, at least somewhat reliable evidence is few. Someone talks about a mysterious noise or flashes in the field, which preceded the appearance of circles. Many potential witnesses complain of memory lapses. Often the discovery of the circles is accompanied by the appearance of men in black suits posing as government agents. They cordon off the scene, but give no intelligible explanation to the locals. At the end of the 90s, a persistent refutation of all conspiracy theories related to crop circles emerged. According to this interpretation, the authors of the crop circles are a community of people who, as a joke or for advertising purposes, trample crop circles at night with a simple device made of a wooden board and rope."
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE1: "M.I.B. agent interrogation report #14571"
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE1_UFOPEDIA: "During the first 36 hours of confinement, the subject began to show acute symptoms of body detoxification and acute withdrawal syndrome kicked in. The subject was administered an IV to counteract body dehydration. Once stabilized, the subject turned out to have almost complete amnesia and remembers absolutely nothing about his MIB service. Apparently, he was abducted from his farm in Nebraska, USA.{NEWLINE}He only remembers that he went to check on some strange noises coming from the his yard of his house, and then a flash of bright light."
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE2: "M.I.B. agent interrogation report #18732"
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE2_UFOPEDIA: "The subject became conscious before he was even taken to the prison block. He exhibited vehement resistance and was given a sedative. However, from the injection he suffered a violent allergic-like reaction. He died four minutes later from anaphylactic shock.{NEWLINE}We studied the blood composition and found a large spectrum of extremely complex psychotropic substances. Unfortunately, they decomposed very quickly and it turned out to be extremely difficult to identify their chemical composition and total effect on the human organism in detail."
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE3: "M.I.B. agent interrogation report #18239"
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE3_UFOPEDIA: "The subject regained consciousness already in the cell, our guys had done a good job on him during arrest. The subject was completely disoriented, he developed extremely severe detoxification symptoms accompanied by acute withdrawal syndrome. After 3 hours his condition began to rapidly deteriorate, he was transferred to the intensive therapy unit and kept there under guard. His kidneys began to malfunction and two hours later he died in convulsions from a cardiac arrest."
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE_STAGE: "M.I.B. agent interrogation report #11378"
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE_STAGE_UFOPEDIA: "In the first hours after detention, the subject showed pronounced aggression, which abruptly switched to apathy. Serious detoxification of the body and manifestations of withdrawal syndrome began. We managed to stabilize the physical condition of the subject, but the mental condition remained fairly grave - acute psychosis, persecution mania and hallucinations were observed. The last thing the subject can remember is that he went out in the evening to buy vodka. A face-to-face database search resulted in an 87% match to a case fitting his described background. The Russian Interior Ministry database contains information about a missing locksmith who worked at the Tver (Central Russia) machine building factory. The report includes his wife's testimony, saying that he went out late at night to buy groceries at a store nearby 6 years ago, but never came back. We also ran a check on his spouse - she remarried 4 months after the incident."
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE4: "M.I.B. agent interrogation report #15537"
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE4_UFOPEDIA: "We successfully detoxified the subject's organism during the first 24 hours of detention and more or less stabilized his mental state. However, standard interrogation methods yielded no valuable information; the subject remembers absolutely nothing about what happened to him over the past 5 years. It was decided to try hypnosis as a last resort and to our surprise it went quite well and the subject even remembered some interesting details:{NEWLINE}'It's night, I'm standing in a forest glade, holding a man I don't know by his expensive tie, with a gun pointed to the back of his head. Next to me stands my partner, dressed in a black, austere suit, his sleeves stained with blood. We're waiting for someone to come, and then a light becomes apparent among the trees. It's the one we've been waiting for.'{NEWLINE}At that moment, however, the subject clutched his head, screamed something incoherent, and convulsed.  A minute later he died as a result of a massive stroke. The recording of his screams was submitted for linguistic expertise." 
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE5: "M.I.B. agent interrogation report #17685"
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE5_UFOPEDIA: "After the subject's physical condition was stabilized, many interrogation techniques were performed on him. Alas, this did not yield the desired result - as with other M.I.B. agents, the subject remembered nothing about this mysterious organization. We decided to take a risk and inject him with 'truth serum' - a strong psychotropic substance used in interrogations. It was a big risk, considering what crazy cocktail was in his blood just recently. Even so, the subject responded well to the injection, and even remembered a few things:{NEWLINE}'I'm driving a black minivan, pulling into the grounds of a big office complex. I pass the parking area and drive around the main building. On the opposite side there is a gate... and ... Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh'.{NEWLINE}The subject clutched his head, started screaming and wriggling, foam coming out of his mouth. A minute later he lost consciousness, and by the time we got him to the medical center he had already fallen into a coma. He died shortly thereafter due to a massive brain hemorrhage."
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE6: "M.I.B. agent interrogation report #16249"
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE6_UFOPEDIA: "The subject regained consciousness under medical supervision, tolerated the symptoms of toxicity quite well, however, during the interrogation it quickly became clear why. From the notes: 'Wow... What a bender! Where am I? Did those two guys bring me here? It turned out that the subject had purchased drugs and was on his way to his apartment when he was approached by two men in black suits. The subject mistook them for narcotics police officers and offered no resistance when they put him in the car. He remembers nothing further."
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE7: "M.I.B. agent interrogation report #058434"
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE7_UFOPEDIA: "After a lengthy course of medical treatment, the subject was able to begin to speak. The last event he was able to recall was two years ago. The subject was in a small village cemetery near Brzeszcze, Poland. From the interrogation protocol: 'I was there that day all alone. It started to get dark, I went to my car and was already getting in - I was going home. But suddenly some light hit my eyes - I remember thinking, What kind of idiot put on his headlights like that?' No interrogation tactics or hypnosis helped to establish additional information."
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE8: "M.I.B. agent interrogation report #223478"
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE8_UFOPEDIA: "Upon coming to himself after a course of medication, the subject was agitated and tried to escape several times, talking about a certain Stevie. It was only after forced sedation that we were able to begin the interrogation. From the transcript: 'Stevie ... he was barking loudly, so I went outside to see what had happened. I got to his booth and... and... Shit, and then I'm here! Where's Stevie?! What's wrong with him?! Let me go!!!' The subject broke free and tried to escape, we had to administer an extra dose of sedative, but it seemed to be incompatible with the substances his captors were drugging him with, and after half an hour the agony began. We were never able to find out where the man was from, we only recorded an Irish accent."
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE9: "M.I.B. agent interrogation report #264568"
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE9_UFOPEDIA: "The subject regained consciousness after 14 hours of drug therapy and dialysis. He said that his last memory was of walking to the store. However, it was noticeable that he was trying to hide something. We applied hypnosis, which revealed that the subject was on his way to a date with a woman he had met in the city library the day before. He was trying to hide this information because he had a wife and two children. We checked police records, the family filed a wanted notice 7 months ago. We were unable to find out any other details essential to the agency"

  STR_FRESH_MIB_AGENT: "M.I.B. agent interrogation report #19723"
  STR_FRESH_MIB_AGENT_UFOPEDIA: "Surprisingly, the subject endured the detox relatively easily, and our therapy was very effective. Soon he was ready for interrogation. Sadly, the drugs they give him suppress his memory very well, so he remembered nothing at all. According to the police reports, he had been kidnapped only a few months before. During the interrogation, physical force was used, the chief of Intelligence punched him in the back of the head with a blunt object. His reaction was extremely strange - he convulsed and mumbled something in a language we didn't know. Ten minutes later, it stopped, and the object remembered nothing of what had happened. The results of this 'experiment' were well reproducible. We got a theory that we were thus hitting some device in his brain, which was confirmed after detailed analysis of radiography. Deep in the brain tissue, we noticed tiny artificial object that we had missed in previous studies. We should probably remove this implant and examine it in detail."
  STR_MIB_AGENT_LOBOTOMY: "M.I.B. Agent Lobotomy"
  STR_MIB_AGENT_LOBOTOMY_UFOPEDIA: "By dissecting the M.I.B. agent's cranium, we were able to remove a strange implant integrated into the frontal and temporal lobes of the cerebral cortex. The device consists of a miniature power supply, a memory unit, a processor, and a complex receiving antenna. We also found that the centers responsible for long-term memory were practically burned out, probably by a strong electrical impulse."
  STR_MIB_HEAD_CHIP: "M.I.B. Head Implant"
  STR_MIB_HEAD_CHIP_UFOPEDIA: "We figured out the power system of the chip, so we can keep it running. Apparently, previously it was recharged from two sources - directly from the electromagnetic activity of the brain, as well as wireless from an external device. It was possible to connect to the microcomputer of the implant, but we are not able to overcome the protection of its firmware and view the embedded programs." #FIXME - redo lore, i dislike it

  STR_MIB_DATA_TRANSFER_DECRYPTION_UFOPEDIA: "The signal that the M.I.B. head chip was tuned to receive was partially decoded. It is a very weak, and the phased array on the surface of the chip is constantly calibrated, adjusting to the direction of the source, in order to enhance the reception.It appears to be less than 1,000 kilometers to the east.  We will be able to localize the source more precisely if we get close to it."
  STR_REGIONAL_HQ_LOCATION: "Regional M.I.B. HQ"
  STR_REGIONAL_HQ_LOCATION_UFOPEDIA: "Now we can be sure that the Men in Black have some sort of headquarters. It's probably where their operations in the region are planned and prepared, their logistics, and possibly the recruitment of new agents. Most likely, it's a rather large structure, hidden under the guise of a civilian facility. We have only a rough idea of the location of this site, but now we have the capability to pick up traces of signals sent out by the M.I.B. We need to plan a covert operation to scout the area of the alleged headquarters."

  STR_STRANGE_CREATURE_AUTOPSY_POSTEVENT_UFOPEDIA: "Chief! The staggering results of that monster autopsy have raised a lot more new questions than answers to old ones. It would be great to research this thing alive, but it is impossible without a special facility at our base. Perhaps by analyzing the Ufopaedia files, we can design a new compartment in which such creatures can be kept safely and completely isolated, while still maintaining access to them for study"
