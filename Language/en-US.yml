  STR_DAMAGE_ARMOR_PIERCING_TOPIC: "Kinetic Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_ARMOR_PIERCING_UFOPEDIA: "Weapons dealing kinetic damage are one of the most reliable and common types of weapons we use. This type of damage is inflicted by accelerating the projectile to a high speed (e.g., by the pressure of expanding propellant gases). It can cause bleeding on impact and the resulting damage reduces the target's combat ability. Because of the widespread use of this type of weapons various means to protect from them are just as common.  Some types of weapons have a certain armor penetration rate, which depends mainly on the type of the projectile and it's speed.{NEWLINE}Additionally, based on previous unfortunate encounters with aliens, we can assume that they have very effective ways of protecting against kinetic damage."
  STR_DAMAGE_INCENDIARY_TOPIC: "Incendiary Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_INCENDIARY_UFOPEDIA: "Incendiary weaponry is often brought into action for denying chokepoints or when standard ordonnance is ineffective. A target set ablaze will take a small but not insignificant amount of damage over time for a while, regulated only by the target's flame resistance, rather than armor values too - afterall, the only ultimate difference between being cooked or charred alive is that in case of the former the remains can end up slightly less scorched. Burning targets will, understandably, loose more morale upon being hit than with other damage types too. Furthermore, enemies with at least a semblance of self-preservation instincts will avoid crossing burning areas unless absolutely necessary."
  STR_DAMAGE_HIGH_EXPLOSIVE_TOPIC: "High Explosive Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_HIGH_EXPLOSIVE_UFOPEDIA: Explosives are a tried and proven way of dislocating obstacles for accessing new routes and hostiles should there be too many of them to take out one by one or when there isn't a good opportunity to target them otherwise in the first place. Explosives, especially the ones specifically designed for that purpose, can also prove invaluable when dealing with highly armored opponents and vehicles. Care and restraint should be taken when using explosives, as a misplaced explosive can prove more detrimental to the user(s) than the designated target."

  STR_DAMAGE_PLASMA_BEAM_UFOPEDIA: STR_DAMAGE_PLASMA_BEAM_UFOPEDIA #TODO
  STR_DAMAGE_STUN_TOPIC: "Stun Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_STUN_UFOPEDIA: "Sometimes killing an opponent can be unpreferable as they might hold important data to be extracted or ransomed away if absolutely necessary. That's where less-lethal tools come into play - batons, rubber rounds or even hand-to-hand combat with sufficient skill and training are the readily available means of pacifying a target, and they are by no means the only ones. However, as the name implies, these weapons are not entirely harmless - most of them also cause normal wounds, limiting their repeatability on a single target. They can also cause shock, resulting in a slow but constant loss of vital signs, until expiration.{NEWLINE}The Aliens also seem to have a ranged version of less-lethal weapons, of an area-of-effect type to boot."
  STR_DAMAGE_MELEE_TOPIC: "Cutting Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_MELEE_UFOPEDIA: "Melee weapons are among the simplest yet still effective types of weapons, bar armored opponents. At close range it might be preferable to dispatch an enemy using by the means of a combat knife or a similar implement given how quick they are to use, especially if the hostiles are the ones approaching. However, using it in other circumstances is inadvisable - risking overextension for an attack that might end up failing is always a bad decision but wanting to engage in melee combat can result in the worst cases of it should there be any complications. It's also relatively easy to be protected from cutting weapons; that goes either way."
  STR_DAMAGE_ACID_TOPIC: "Acid Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_ACID_UFOPEDIA: STR_DAMAGE_ACID_UFOPEDIA #TODO
  STR_DAMAGE_SMOKE_TOPIC: "Choke Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_SMOKE_UFOPEDIA: "Smoke can provide a helpful, if intangible, cover from enemy fire. It can also become a hazard - inhaling smoke from any source will eventually result in loss of consciousness from decreased access to oxygen. It can be used to facilitate captures but overstaying in smoke could end up in a shock not unlike the one caused by abuse of stun weaponry. Thus it's ill-advised for wounded troops to stay long, or in worst cases at all, in smokescreens, grenade-made or otherwise."

  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE1_CAPTION: "The Council of Funding Nations has decided to terminate the X-COM project and all its activities. Perhaps this has something to do with the recent changes of Council membership, with several of its members facing clearly fabricated charges. Agents of a top secret supragovernmental organization known to us as the Men in Black have been assigned to the Council as the exclusive security force. We are confident that the purpose of this organization extends far beyond the protection services - there are reasons to suspect them of aiding the aliens, and they are trying to cover up any traces of their activity."
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE2_CAPTION: "The Commander of X-COM has been called to the Council to receive the final instructions. Two days later, he returned to the base accompanied by M.I.B. agents and initiated the 'Oblivion' protocol: an irreversible encryption of the Ufopaedia (X-COM's archive of scientific and technological achievements), decreed dismissal of all personnel and issued orders to dismantle the base facilities."
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE3_CAPTION: "All of his colleagues noticed some peculiar changes in his behavior - communication became more drastic and formal and there was a steep decrease of empathy.

  STR_SCIENTIST_REFUGE_ALERT_DESCRIPTION: We have received a signal from the secret hideout of the important Resistance member. Apparently, M.I.B. agents managed to locate it and the Resistance asked us to launch a rescue operation as soon as possible.
  STR_SCIENTIST_REFUGE_BRIEFING: "A prominent scientist witnessed an alien abduction about a year ago. Since then he abandoned a brilliant career and devoted himself to studying the activities of hostile extraterrestrials. He soon attracted attention of the Men in Black and was forced into hiding. He set up a small house deep in the woods, and there in near total isolation continued his research. Apparently, his location became known to the M.I.B. and they would soon pull in a substantial force to eliminate such an important bystander. The scientist's salvation could be of great value to us, and we must get him to the vessel in one piece. In order to launch the craft, click on the 'Abort Mission' icon."

  STR_DESERT_TELESCOPE_BRIEFING: "It seems our guys were uncovered. Their sandy shelter was difficult to see even if you stood nearby, because it can go almost 100% underground in critical situations so as not to give itself out. If you do this now, then they will simply suffocate, while the MIB staff will wait in the wings. We need to help our guys and help them get out of there."

His perseverance led to the fact that they were able to make sure of who we really are. If there is no way back, all that remains is to move forward, sweeping away everything in its path. This is what we need to do now."
  STR_MIB_CHASING: "Chasing M.I.B."
  STR_MIB_CHASING_BRIEFING: "We continued our investigation when suddenly a car started chasing us and drove us into a trap. There are no options to sit in the car or surrender, so we will have to fight, because not only our lives are at stake, but also the lives of those people we must take care of."

This legend is more than 500 years old, and in front of you, perhaps, a descendant of the king. This animal belongs to the canine family. On the head there are characteristic growths in the form of thorns. The coat is short, thin. What surprised me the most was the color of the blood. The blood is green.

Thirdly, due to its weight and structure, the helicopter cannot carry thick armor, as a result of which it has little protection. On the other hand, it is very convenient to use in everyday life - it does not take up much space and does not require a runway for takeoff. Of course, this is not the best option for the operation, because most likely you will be knocked down on the approach to the point, or those for whom you are flying will simply run away, and you will not be able to overtake them, but in general, this is a good thing."

After closing the workshop our production capacity is at a minimum, we are trying to assemble spare parts from improvised materials. It is absolutely unclear where we will get the supplies from now, even the most basic ones.

Centralized use of direct radio links, even if encrypted, is not reasonable either - our enemies will be able to track the source of the signals and destroy it. Fortunately, we live in an age of booming decentralized computer networks! By hacking hundreds of thousands of personal computers online, our IT specialists have deployed an entire system of sophisticated proxy servers. Our encrypted messages are embedded in massive data flows and mixed with a vast amount of false messages being sent.

  STR_BASE_DEFENSE_COMBAT_ANALYSIS: "Base defense tactical analysis"
  STR_BASE_DEFENSE_COMBAT_ANALYSIS_UFOPEDIA: "Tactical analysis of the recent assault on our base has exposed several significant security vulnerabilities. Although most of the complex is underground, some of its modules have a direct connection to the surface. The obvious point of enemy penetration into the base is the entry lift. In addition, our aircraft perform vertical take-off from the hangars. Despite our attempts to disguise the closing casements of our hangars they can still be easily detected from the ground. Enemies blasted a few holes in the casements and went down on ropes inside. There is a good chance that our enemies will use the hangars to break into the base in the future as well. Unfortunately, these circumstances were not taken into account in the initial base design, and now we need to think about how to improve the defense systems, and also to pay more attention to the base layout."
  STR_COVERT_OPERATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "Due to the clear dominance of our enemy, the preferred strategy will be keeping a low profile when dealing with important strategic tasks. We can send our agents to covert operations for more subtle methods of solving a problem than an open attack. The secure channels we've developed allow us to coordinate agents remotely, and for some operations, it is also important to involve scientists for analytical work and engineers to design the special gear. A covert operation is always a risk, and in order to increase your success odds you should be careful when choosing your team and equipment. Any little thing, in the end, can play a key role."

  STR_RESISTANCE_CONTACT_UFOPEDIA: "The Resistance is a voluntary union of people not willing to obey the new world regime. This initiative began to emerge in the early '70s and in the beginning, consisted of ufologists and conspiracy theorists. Who could ever guess that they would be in the right? In the past few years, the Resistance began to be joined by a large number of very different people - scientists, journalists, doctors, ordinary people, and even former military officers. They all had one thing in common - they had somehow come into contact with the aliens and now Men in Black are hunting them down. Most of those who have discovered even a little about the aliens after a very short time have disappeared under mysterious and often frightening circumstances. The rest learn to hide well and form guerrilla cells around the world. The goal of the Resistance is to unite and protect these disparate groups, reveal the mysterious plans of the invaders, and consolidate all mankind against an extraterrestrial threat."

Of course, the equipment we are purchasing is far from cutting-edge technology, but at least it will allow us to maintain the average combat capability of our agents and be ready to conduct various operations."

  STR_SUPPLIES_UFOPEDIA: "In the current circumstances we must act as carefully as possible to avoid unnecessary attention to ourselves. Fortunately, in many aspects our base is autonomous - we have a source of drinking water and electricity generators. We have developed a system by which we can organize safe purchases of food and basic supplies, and some simple spare parts in several nearby cities. We've had major funding issues for a long time, so we're already left with people who put the fight against aliens ahead of taking care of their personal earnings. We've resigned contracts with all the staff, all of them willing to continue working on the project voluntarily, as long as we take care of providing them with everything they need to work, and it would be good to keep the morale high."
  STR_LOYALTY: "Loyalty"
  STR_LOYALTY_UFOPEDIA: "The X-COM Project was officially shut down and now we can only count on ourselves. The loss of the Council’s support is a severe blow to our organization but despite all hard circumstances our people are determined to fight against alien invaders at all costs. 'Ad victoriam' - that’s our new motto! Today isn’t money determining our future, but how strong our men’s spirit is. It is essential not to let the morale go down and there are many points of influence on it. The successful operations against our adversaries, major scientific and technological breakthroughs, and progress towards understanding the nature of our enemies, - all these factors will significantly raise the morale and bring the team together, that’s why we should be extremely careful and wise in our strategic and tactical choices."
  STR_FACILITIES_BLUEPRINTS: "Facility blueprints"
  STR_FACILITIES_BLUEPRINTS_UFOPEDIA: "We deciphered the Ufopaedia segments containing plans for the various base facilities. Unfortunately, some of them had to be dismantled last year, and some had never been built. Since we have figured out how to get basic construction materials, we can start the construction work if necessary and if we have money to buy everything we need. Of course, it will take some time to remove soil, reinforce walls and ceilings, and install internal equipment. In addition, most of the specialized facilities require special equipment, and we will have to figure out how to get it."

  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE1: "M.I.B. agent interrogation report #14571"
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE1_UFOPEDIA: "We caught one of them. It's been a long time since this happened, so we can celebrate. However, our prisoner vomited for a long time, as far as we know - these are signs of detoxification of the body. The stuff they're drugged with takes away not only their brains, but their memories as well. The agent could not answer the question 'Where have you been recently?'. We had to use a couple of effective methods, but it did not give the desired result. To the question 'Where are your main forces?' our hero replied that he does not even understand what forces we are talking about. Our operatives can make him talk, but it does not look like a simulation here, and he really does not remember anything. Complete amnesia."
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE2: "M.I.B. agent interrogation report #18732"
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE2_UFOPEDIA: "After the capture of one of the MIB, we hoped to extract as much information as possible, but the hard withdrawal on unknown drugs did not let him go, and only strong painkillers allowed us to hear not only screams from his side. He's already starting to remember, but it takes time. The last thing I remember clearly is the farm and the crop circles. 'What kind of farm?' 'I don't remember, but what else does he remember?' Oh, yes, a flash of light. Apparently this is the last thing that ordinary people see before they go to the dark side. Do they do evil against their own will? How awful. Strong physical form began to rapidly decline at the same time as detoxification, perhaps we should also think about such chemistry? I'm kidding."
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE3: "M.I.B. agent interrogation report #8239"
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE3_UFOPEDIA: "We caught a Men in Black agent. This person does not want to give out information or simply cannot do it. He says that he does not remember anything and does not understand where he got such muscles. Very soon we will change our methods and move on to a tougher interrogation, but the guys who work with him claim that this will not give results. We will use the most brutal methods in the hope that he will still give out information. It is not he who is important to us, but the data that is in his head. It may be immoral, but in war all is fair."
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE4: "M.I.B. agent interrogation report #11378"
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE4_UFOPEDIA: "With great difficulty, we still managed to get a living agent of the Men in Black. We managed to get him to the place where he will be interrogated. So far, he claims that there is a flash of light and that he never lies. Oh well. His vows by anything in words will not be enough for the command and will certainly have to work with him for quite a long time. The process complicates the process of detoxification of the body, which forces doctors to be nearby. While they are nearby, the impression is created that this is not an interrogation, but simply questions that you can not answer and nothing will happen. Having removed the doctors, he may become worse, we are trapped in the situation."
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE5: "M.I.B. agent interrogation report #15537"
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE5_UFOPEDIA: "The Men in Black agent is in our hands. Allegations of outbreaks and amnesia are already tired of us. When will they come up with something new? People who work with him are already beginning to believe in this nonsense and will soon refuse to conduct interrogations, because it is pointless. We have not received any information from a person who fought on the side of the enemy for a long time and may have been present at the bases, saw what and how is happening inside, perhaps knows the location of important objects. He doesn't say anything. We continue to work."
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE6: "M.I.B. agent interrogation report #16249"
  STR_EMPTY_MIB_EARLY_LORE6_UFOPEDIA: "We have an agent of the Men in Black in captivity. This person claims the outbreak is the last event he remembers. Strong detoxification of the body is not the best sight. He is clearly feeling bad, but our questions make it even worse. Maybe it's time to stop? He's telling the truth, he really doesn't know about any men in black or any bases. He earned muscle while serving in the army, which is confirmed by old archives. No, it doesn't say that he has muscles, there are photographs. It is a pity that we were not able to obtain useful information, perhaps this person will continue to serve with us if he undergoes an adaptation course."
