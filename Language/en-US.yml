  STR_DAMAGE_ARMOR_PIERCING_TOPIC: "Kinetic Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_ARMOR_PIERCING_UFOPEDIA: "Weapons dealing kinetic damage are one of the most reliable and common types of weapons we use. This type of damage is inflicted by accelerating the projectile to a high speed (e.g., by the pressure of expanding propellant gases). It can cause bleeding on impact and the resulting damage reduces the target's combat ability. Because of the widespread use of this type of weapons various means to protect from them are just as common.  Some types of weapons have a certain armor penetration rate, which depends mainly on the type of the projectile and its speed.{NEWLINE}Additionally, based on previous unfortunate encounters with aliens, we can assume that they have very effective ways of mitigating kinetic damage."
  STR_DAMAGE_INCENDIARY_TOPIC: "Incendiary Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_INCENDIARY_UFOPEDIA: "Incendiary weaponry is often brought into action to deny chokepoints or when standard ordinance is ineffective. A target set ablaze will take a small but not insignificant amount of damage over time for a while, which is only regulated by the target's flame resistance rather than armor values too - after all, the only difference between being cooked and charred alive is that in case of the former the remains can end up slightly less scorched. Fire damage will also, understandably, make the target lose more morale than most other damage types. Furthermore, enemies with at least a semblance of self-preservation instincts will avoid crossing burning areas unless absolutely necessary."
  STR_DAMAGE_HIGH_EXPLOSIVE_TOPIC: "High Explosive Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_HIGH_EXPLOSIVE_UFOPEDIA: "Explosives are a tried and proven way of erasing obstacles to access new routes, as well as hostiles, should there be too many of them to take out one by one. Or, when there isn't a good opportunity to target them otherwise in the first place. Explosives can also prove invaluable when dealing with highly armored opponents and vehicles, especially the ones specifically designed for that purpose. Care and restraint should be exercised when using explosives, as a misplaced bomb can prove more detrimental to the user(s) than the designated target."

  STR_DAMAGE_PLASMA_BEAM_UFOPEDIA: STR_DAMAGE_PLASMA_BEAM_UFOPEDIA #FIXME
  STR_DAMAGE_STUN_TOPIC: "Stun Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_STUN_UFOPEDIA: "Although killing an enemy is usually the easiest way to win in terms of tactics, sometimes capturing the enemy alive is worth the extra effort. Some enemies may have critical information for us, and we need to interrogate them to move forward in unraveling the aliens' plans. Stunning an enemy will incapacitate them for several turns. If we manage to disable all other enemies or get the stunned unit to our craft and leave the battlefield before it wakes up, it will be taken to the base and placed in our containment facility."
  STR_DAMAGE_MELEE_TOPIC: "Cutting Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_MELEE_UFOPEDIA: "Melee weapons are among the simplest yet still effective types of weapons, if one's opponents aren't armored. At close range it might be preferable to dispatch an enemy by means of a combat knife or a similar implement given how quick they are to use, especially if the hostiles are the ones approaching. However, using it in other circumstances is inadvisable - risking overextension for an attack that might end up failing is always a bad decision but wanting to engage in melee combat can lead to the worst results should any complications arise. It's also relatively easy to be protected from cutting weapons; that goes either way."
  STR_DAMAGE_ACID_TOPIC: "Chemical Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_ACID_UFOPEDIA: "Most of the damage chemical weapons inflict is due to aggressive substances - acids or bases applied to the enemy's body. Chemicals can have a pronounced corrosive effect on enemy armor, as well as cause severe chemical burns to the skin, sometimes incompatible with life. The fumes produced by the reaction can be toxic and damage the respiratory tract if inhaled. The enemies may spend part of their turn trying to shake off the compound."
  STR_DAMAGE_SMOKE_TOPIC: "Choke Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_SMOKE_UFOPEDIA: "Smoke can provide a helpful, if intangible, cover from enemy fire. It can also become a hazard - inhaling smoke from any source will eventually result in loss of consciousness from oxygen deprivation. It can be used to facilitate captures but overstaying in smoke could lead to a shock not unlike the one caused by abuse of stun weaponry. Thus it's ill-advised for wounded troops to stay long - or in worst cases at all - in smokescreens, grenade-made or otherwise."
  STR_DAMAGE_EMP_TOPIC: "EMP Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_EMP_UFOPEDIA: STR_DAMAGE_EMP_UFOPEDIA #FIXME
  STR_DAMAGE_ELECTRIC_TOPIC: "Electric Damage"
  STR_DAMAGE_ELECTRIC_UFOPEDIA: "An electric shock is caused when a person is exposed to and/or comes into contact with a source of electricity, thus sending an electrical current through a portion of the person's body. A common person can perceive a passing alternating or direct current greater than 1 or 5 mA respectively. In addition, at high-voltage installations one can experience an electric shock without touching live parts as a result of an air breakdown with the formation of an electric arc. As a result of an electric shock, the target will experience convulsions and loss of consciousness; a high-power shock can result in death."

#cutscenes
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE1_CAPTION: "The Council of Funding Nations has decided to terminate the X-COM project and all its activities. Perhaps this has something to do with the recent changes of Council membership, with several of its members facing clearly fabricated charges. Agents of a top secret supragovernmental organization known to us as the Men in Black have been assigned to the Council as the exclusive security force. We are confident that the purpose of this organization extends far beyond the protection services - there are reasons to suspect them of aiding the aliens, and they are trying to cover up any traces of their activity."
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE2_CAPTION: "Commander of X-COM has been called to the Council to receive the final instructions. Two days later, he returned to the base accompanied by M.I.B. agents and initiated the 'Oblivion' protocol: an irreversible encryption of the Ufopaedia (X-COM's archive of scientific and technological achievements), decreed dismissal of all personnel and issued orders to dismantle the base facilities."
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE3_CAPTION: "All of his colleagues noticed some peculiar changes in his behavior - communication became more drastic and formal and there was a steep decrease of empathy. We have already documented such personality changes in some of our field agents, and we assume that this indicates some form of external mind control. You know the Commander well, he would never so easily destroy what we have been working on so hard all these years!"
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE4_CAPTION: "Dr. Meyer, chief of the research department, tried to prevent the loss of scientific data. Unfortunately, espionage was not his strong suit and he was caught trying to back up the Ufopedia.{NEWLINE}Commander shot his old friend without even blinking an eye!"

  STR_ABANDONED_BASE_BRIEFING: "The assault squad disembarked near the entrance of the abandoned subsurface base. It's obviously been disused for a long time - the entrance is partially blocked with sand, and the hangar hatch is open. There is activity on the lower level of the facility, therefore extreme caution is required. It is necessary to descend underground and clear the area.{NEWLINE}To abort the mission return X-Com operatives to the green area and click on the 'Abort Mission' icon."

  STR_CHASING_MIB: "Chasing M.I.B."
  STR_CHASING_MIB_DESCRIPTION: "We should track down the Men in Black forces that attacked our base. They headed east, and it is unlikely they could get very far in such a transport. The operation objective is to investigate the settlements in the sector, interview the locals and attempt to gain access to the video surveillance systems.  While this is our only lead, we need to learn more about our enemy to anticipate their next move."

  STR_REGIONAL_HQ_AREA_SURVEY_DESCRIPTION: "We are on the trail of the Men in Black. After that incident on the road, there is absolute confidence that we are moving in the right direction. We received a little more information and already know exactly which city we have to go to. This urban area has long been teeming with interference and unknown signals. Most likely, this is where the M.I.B. secret base is located. We need to investigate further."
  STR_REGIONAL_HQ_AREA_SURVEY_RESULTS_DESCRIPTION: "Our agents were able to confirm that the regional headquarters of the Men in Black is somewhere within the city under investigation. Unfortunately, we are unable to pinpoint the exact location of the secret base. A thorough scan of the radio frequencies revealed a channel of multi-stream encrypted data, but we have not succeeded in deciphering it or locating the source of the signal."

  STR_REGIONAL_HQ: "M.I.B. Regional HQ"
  STR_REGIONAL_HQ_DESCRIPTION: "Undoubtedly, the activity of M.I.B. agents originates from some center where their operations are planned, organized and logistically supplied. It is necessary to investigate further and locate this place."
  STR_REGIONAL_HQ_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION: "Our agents were able to locate what we believe may be the center of all M.I.B. operations in the region. While remaining undetected, they established external surveillance of the facility using recruited locals. The center is disguised as a financial organization; perhaps the M.I.B. base is located directly under the building. They're clearly up to something - we're seeing M.I.B. forces converging on the facility. We have two options: launch an assault on the site or wait and survey the location. Maybe we can find something that will help us storm the compound."
  STR_REGIONAL_HQ_FAILURE_DESCRIPTION: "Our agents were able to locate what we believe may be the center of all M.I.B. operations in the region. Not everything went perfectly well, but we set up outside surveillance of the facility, recruiting some local residents.

  STR_REGIONAL_HQ_SURVEY_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION: "We were able to locate a sewage canal which runs directly under the structure in which we believe the M.I.B. headquarters is located. Information about it has been carefully concealed; it is not on any of the current plans. However, we managed to find a retired engineer who showed us an entrance to the underground communications suite and provided approximate plans. This will allow us to approach the complex undetected."
  STR_REGIONAL_HQ_SURVEY_FAILURE_DESCRIPTION: "We investigated the area where the M.I.B. headquarters is located as exhaustively as we could. Alas, this structure is quite well-protected, has its own communications system and allows no access from the outside. The only assault option left is to gather a squad stealthily in the house from which we monitor the building. When we are ready, we strike directly, breaking into the office as burglars and breaching the M.I.B.'s headquarters."

  STR_RESISTANCE_CELL_CREATION_FAILURE_DESCRIPTION: "We failed to organize a new Resistance cell close to the M.I.B. headquarters. We were to meet at the safe house, but as we approached it there was an agreed upon sign. A flower on the windowsill - signifying danger, a complete failure of the operation.

  STR_EX_COUNCIL_DATA_VAULT_CONVEY_DESCRIPTION_SUCCESS: "We were able to contact a former Council member's contact and transfer the Data Vault to him.

  STR_STEAL_OSPREY_OPERATION: "Steal the Osprey"
  STR_STEAL_OSPREY_OPERATION_DESCRIPTION: "Our agents will disguise themselves as personnel servicing decommissioned equipment.

  STR_INFILTRATING_MILITARY_RND_DESCRIPTION: "We have developed a plan to infiltrate a secret military R&D facility that designs the latest weapons and equipment for the army. This technology could prove indispensable in our fight against alien invasion. By bribing officials we plan to infiltrate the base in the guise of workers and sneak through the elevator shaft. It's prudent to use concealed and silent weapons, the sounds of gunfire can raise the alarm on the base. Non-lethal weapons are recommended, as killing innocent guards who happen to be the victims of our raid could end up hurting the morale of our men."
  STR_INFILTRATING_MILITARY_RND_FAILURE_DESCRIPTION: "The contact who was supposed to bring our soldiers to the military RnD facility betrayed us by alerting the guards at the base. Our soldiers had to flee the pursuit and fight off the military."

The last thing he remembers is how he left the house at night when he saw a strange glow in his cornfield. This happened in July 1996. Judging by his constitution, reaction and combat training, it's hard to believe that we're looking at a simple farmer. It'd be easier to believe he's an elite special agent but, as far as we can tell, his story seems genuine. Unfortunately, all attempts to get more information led to nothing."

  STR_MIB_AGENT_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "M.I.B. agents have good combat training and are masters of various weapons, but they are only human beings and have no significant advantage over our trained soldiers. Typically, agents do not wear body armor, which allows them to retain disguise and mobility."

His equipment uses the latest scientific achievements in the field of armor materials and optical systems. Unfortunately, the suit has a safety mechanism that rendered it unusable. The soldier remembers nothing about what happened to him before the operation we managed to capture him.

  STR_MIB_BUTCHER_UFOPEDIA: "It is hard to believe that such incredible muscle mass can be gained through normal exercise and diet. These operatives have inhuman strength, health and stamina and are especially dangerous in close combat. A study of DNA samples revealed mutations in the genes encoding the production of myostatin, a protein that inhibits the growth and differentiation of muscle tissue. The nature of this mutation remains unclear, but the other mutations perfectly maintain the stability and organicity of the individual."
  STR_MIB_BUTCHER_ARMOR: "M.I.B. Butcher Combat Analysis"
  STR_MIB_BUTCHER_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "Despite their brutal strength and advanced melee skills, Butchers are usually poor marksmen and almost never wear heavy armor. Small-caliber weapons can't do them much damage, but a shotgun blast at close range can be very effective."

  STR_MIB_ENFORCER_CORPSE: "M.I.B. Enforcer Corpse"
  STR_MIB_ENFORCER_UFOPEDIA: "Enforcers serve as heavy duty units and usually guard the most important M.I.B. installations. Their primary mission is to destroy anyone who gains unauthorized access to the facility. Rarely they are used in punitive operations where high firepower is required. The subject has undergone a massive psychological conditioning - his personality is almost completely erased, leaving only weapon skills, polished to an instinctive level, as well as absolute loyalty to his masters. An example of human transformation into a perfect war machine."

  STR_MIB_MEDIC_UFOPEDIA: "M.I.B. medics have a broad knowledge of medicine, neurobiology, formacology and good surgical skills. They 'recruit' new M.I.B. agents by administering a complex array of chemicals, as well as brain surgery and powerful electromagnetic radiation. An important task is the medical maintenance of the active agents, which includes both treatment of injuries and maintenance of blood concentrations of previously administered drugs.

  STR_SEEKER_DRONE_UFOPEDIA: "A unique specimen preserved in near-perfect condition. The electronics and processing core are technologically far superior to anything we have encountered before. And the logic unit features a breakthrough implementation of biotechnology centuries ahead of Earth's technology. The drone has high speed and maneuverability, with peripheral visual and thermal sensors that allow it to easily identify the enemy. Its energy weapons are certainly of great interest for further study."
  STR_SEEKER_DRONE_CORPSE_UFOPEDIA: "It is difficult to identify the manufacturer of this drone from the remaining wreckage. Apparently, it was equipped with some sort of self-destruct device. All the electronics were almost completely scorched out, with only ash left of the central computing units. Only the wiring and weapons control system were partially intact. The weapon itself is some kind of powerful energy emitter. Alas, the high degree of damage prevents any hope of reverse engineering."
  STR_SEEKER_DRONE_ARMOR: "Seeker Drone Combat Analysis"

  STR_XCOM_EX_COMMANDER_EXAMINATION: "Former X-COM Commander Examination"
  STR_XCOM_EX_COMMANDER_EXAMINATION_UFOPEDIA: "Apparently, the former Commander's mind is still under alien control, despite the loss of consciousness and prolonged imprisonment. He refuses to communicate and shows aggression at every opportunity. All of our interrogation methods have proven ineffective and the method aliens use to maintain control is still unclear to us. During the physical examination there were no signs of any surgical intervention, with all medical tests within the normal range (except for adrenaline). Safekeeping can be problematic as, for example, he had a chance to bite off a finger of a former colleague which he took, successfully."

  STR_MIB_OFFICE_ENGINEER_UFOPEDIA: "The engineer who maintains the building of the financial organization covering the M.I.B. headquarters did not tell us anything particularly important, except for one curious fact - there were unusually powerful directional transmitters on the roof of the building for an unknown purpose."

  STR_MIB_OFFICE_SECURITY_UFOPEDIA: "Hired through a private security organization, this security officer does not have any valuable information. He did not have access to many areas of the office (apparently, all the ones used by M.I.B.). He once saw a black truck pull into the garage and thought he saw someone inside calling for help.

He was convinced that it was a top-secret government organization, they had managed to bribe and intimidate him, so the banker did not ask too many questions.

  STR_CULT_COORDINATOR_UFOPEDIA: "Having interrogated the bandit coordinator, we learned something interesting and unusual about their gang. In the past they were mainly involved in drug trafficking and smuggling, as well as fighting over territory with neighboring gangs. However, since recently, everything has changed very drastically - all the heads of the gangs known to him gradually united and stopped feuding, the usual types of earnings have moved into the background. Now very often the rank-and-file gang members are involved in kidnapping people, as he thinks - for a ransom. At the same time, he has never heard of anyone being released. All the prisoners are taken to the gang headquarters, and from there they are taken by people he does not know."

  STR_FACEHUGGER_UFOPEDIA: "This rubbish jumps on a victim, using its stinger to inject the parasite with a neuroparalytic poison. The parasite quickly makes its way through the body and attaches itself to the brain of the host with its flagella. The parasite completely controls the signals sent to the spinal cord, artificially keeping the person alive. At the moment of application of the parasite, it is still connected for some time with the facehugger, but before the latter breaks apart it is restrained by cramps, and because of the physical strain it has a ruptured heart and dies, letting the victim go. The details of this terrible process are still not clear to us."

The contents of the sac is a separate organism, connected to its host by a network of thick nerve tubes. Unfortunately, the contents of the sac have been damaged and almost nothing is left of the parasite, as it decomposes extremely quickly in the air environment."

A parasite sits inside the body, which has disabled all organism systems and controls movement. If you destroy the parasite, the body will be just a piece of meat. It decomposes quickly, because the blood has long been oxidized and the organs do not keep the body in proper condition. Motility and immunity are absent."
  STR_FRESH_ZOMBIE_CORPSE: "Zombie corpse"
  STR_ZOMBIE_STERILE_AUTOPSY: "Zombie Autopsy"
  STR_ZOMBIE_STERILE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The parasite was extracted from the zombie. It is clear that the body is dead and decomposes quickly, a large number of microorganisms were found inside that feed on dead flesh. Due to the lack of motility and immunity, some organs and systems of the body have stumbled so much that they very remotely resemble their original."
  STR_FRESH_ZOMBIE_ARMOR: "Zombie Combat Analysis"
  STR_FRESH_ZOMBIE_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "Zombies are dangerous only at close range. They have no tactics, are slow, disorganized, and usually pile up in droves. Zombie are completely immune to pain, and their bodies are controlled not by their brains, but by a parasite entrenched in their chests. The lack of armor makes slashing weapons and buckshot especially effective."
  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_TERRORIST: "Fat Zombie"
  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_UFOPEDIA: "The reaction of the body to the poison that was injected by the parasite caused a strong transformation of the body. As a result, the whole body was swollen and overgrown with fat. The muscles were also covered with fat, which now created a monster with great physical strength. Due to the abundance of flesh and fat, this specimen can take many shots. It is recommended to use a large caliber when seeing this organism in battle."
  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_CORPSE: "Fat Zombie corpse"
  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_AUTOPSY: "Fat Zombie Autopsy"
  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This zombie's body is filled with fat inside and out, its organs are much larger than normal, and there are signs of necrosis and putrefaction all over its body. Because of its great physical strength and enormous body size, it needs a lot of food to maintain its energy balance. The parasite was extracted and successfully removed."
  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_ARMOR: "Fat Zombie Combat Analysis"
  STR_ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "Fat zombies are clumsy, but very strong and survivable foes. They don't have any armor, but single small-caliber bullets can simply get stuck in thick layers of fat without causing significant damage to bones or internal organs. Only massive burst damage can bring down such a monster."
  STR_CHUPACABRA: "Chupacabra"
  STR_CHUPACABRA_CORPSE: "Chupacabra Corpse"
  STR_CHUPACABRA_UFOPEDIA: "An incredibly efficient predator, perfectly adapted to hunting in the woods and hilly prairies. Its powerful hind paws allow it to achieve tremendous speed in its spurt, and its front paws with razor-sharp claws leave its victim not the slightest chance. Moreover, its great reflexes and chitinous body spikes provide a good defense in a fight with almost any terrestrial animal."
  STR_CHUPACABRA_AUTOPSY: "Chupacabra Autopsy"
  STR_CHUPACABRA_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "In the structure of the skull and some skeletal features, this creature is similar to the canine group of animals. However, the unfolded pelvis, long hind limbs and the development of forelegs indicate adaptation to straight walking. This is a non-mammalian species, which reproduces by laying eggs. Surprisingly, it has green blood, which for terrestrial animals is very rare and not found in warm-blooded animals."
  STR_CHUPACABRA_ARMOR: "Chupacabra Combat Analysis"
  STR_CHUPACABRA_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "A ferocious and swift predator that uses both teeth and claws as well as chitinous spines in combat. It has an excellent sensitivity and orientates itself well in the dark. Its skin does not offer any special protective qualities."
  STR_ARMADILLO: "Armadillo"
  STR_ARMADILLO_CORPSE: "Armadillo Corpse"
  STR_ARMADILLO_UFOPEDIA: "It is an extremely strong and hardy creature, with a very good protection system due to its structure. Adapting to uprightness is far from complete, it moves clumsily and hunched over, often helping itself with its arms when running. In close combat, it uses its forelegs with razor-sharp claws and a powerful jaw with massive fangs. In case of danger, it crouches on the ground and puts forward a strong carapace. It is unclear how these creatures reproduce, and the result of DNA deciphering suggests intensive artificial gene modifications being carried out on this species."
  STR_ARMADILLO_AUTOPSY: "Armadillo Autopsy"
  STR_ARMADILLO_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "An anthropomorphic creature resembling an armadillo shocked our scientists. The skeletal structure, muscular and circulatory systems are striking, although adaptation to uprightness is far from complete. The most noticeable feature is the convex, incredibly strong shell on the back, to which the spine is attached. It forms a rather large cavity, causing all the vital organs to shift further away from the ribs, and the space freed is used to form something like a fibrous subcutaneous body armor. The creature's skin is covered with small, extremely tough, sand-colored scales."
  STR_ARMADILLO_ARMOR: "Armadillo Combat Analysis"
  STR_ARMADILLO_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "The armadillo has excellent natural resistance to a wide variety of kinds of damage. It is savage and dangerous in melee combat. Fortunately, it is rather bumbling when moving around."

  STR_SWARMIDS_SMALL_TERRORIST: "Swarmids"
  STR_SWARMIDS_AUTOPSY: "Swarmids Autopsy"
  STR_SWARMIDS_UFOPEDIA: "Swarmids are unlike any other creature known to science. They aggressively search for prey, spotting them using their well developed multi-ocular structure. The eyes can work independently so the creature can see reasonably well unless all of them are damaged. Their stinger is very robust; it has difficulties penetrating heavy armor directly, but they instinctively seek out weak spots, leaving pheromones as a signal to the rest of the swarm. Conventional projectile-based weapons are of little use, only explosions and especially fire can damage them consistently."
  STR_SWARMIDS_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The body of this insectoid creature comprises a slightly armored torso and a flexible tail. The torso hosts a slot containing multiple articulated eyes and is surmounted by three pairs of wings. The tail is wholly muscle tissue, similar to the human tongue, and it ends with a fearsome stinger used for attacking prey."
  STR_SWARMIDS_SMALL_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: A swarm of aggressive insects poses a serious danger to our soldiers. The carnivorous flies penetrate into the smallest crevices of almost any armor. At the same time, the swarm itself is virtually immune to firearms and melee attacks.
  STR_AMPHIBIAN: "Amphibian"
  STR_AMPHIBIAN_CORPSE: "Amphibian Corpse"
  STR_AMPHIBIAN_UFOPEDIA: "The creature is clearly amphibious, looking like a hybrid of a different species of frogs and a gorilla. It is capable of spitting venom and inherits from the gorilla its powerful body, fury, and sharp teeth.Apparently, these creatures hunt large mammals, paralyze their prey with poison, and drag it into the water, where it will suffer a painful death by drowning while its helpless body is torn apart. The creatures lay their eggs directly in the under-eaten remains of their victims, to provide their offspring with nutrition immediately after hatching."
  STR_AMPHIBIAN_AUTOPSY: "Amphibian Autopsy"
  STR_AMPHIBIAN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "In the structure of its head and torso with its internal organs, this creature is most similar to a frog, while its forelimbs, hind limbs, and the structure of the shoulder complex rather refer to primates, such as the gorilla. An important feature is the presence of many massive glands that secrete a strong neuroparalytic toxin, and the structure of the pharynx allows this monster to spit venom over long distances. Apparently, the hybrid is capable of changing sex when necessary, which ensures the good survivability of this species."
  STR_AMPHIBIAN_ARMOR: "Amphibian Combat Analysis"
  STR_AMPHIBIAN_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "Although this creature lacks any meaningful natural defense against firearms, its ability to spit neuroparalytic venom makes it a significant threat on the battlefield. Because of its large size and impressive muscle mass, weapons with high power are recommended."

We ran all the tests, but found no signs of diseases like rabies. We are most likely seeing the result of alien psionic exposure to the dogs, but we haven't documented anything like that before."

When our soldiers got to the ground level of the base, the remaining men in black plunged into two black vans and fled eastwards. The attempt to follow them has failed.{NEWLINE}If you think about it, the situation overall is hardly better - we have lost the funding and supply source and know very little about our enemy. Apparently, alien agents have infiltrated deep into government structures, probably even the Council itself. What is clear is that now we can only count on ourselves.{NEWLINE}In the meantime, it is necessary to gather status reports on the core units and understand what we still have to do.

Ufopedia is encrypted, and that's what's bothering me the most right now but I think there's still hope! I suggest we begin decrypting it immediately.

Due to lack of funding, we were forced to close several facilities and sell off valuable equipment. Since the workshop was closed, our production capacity is at a minimum, and we are trying to assemble spare parts from the materials at hand. It is obvious that with our current facilities we are not able to produce combat weapons. However, my guys are trying to adapt any available corner of the base to accommodate at least simple machines. Our engineers are extremely talented and can assemble anything from complete junk!

  STR_XCOM_FUNDAMENTAL_STUDIES_DESCRIPTION: "Having decrypted Ufopedia, we now have access to our fundamental research. Alas, due to lack of funding, most of it was conducted (or at least leaded) by Dr. Meyer personally, and we will need some time to analyze his notes. Perhaps we should devote resources to this.{NEWLINE}{ALT}New research project available."
  STR_XCOM_FUNDAMENTAL_STUDIES_UFOPEDIA: "We were unable to obtain any valuable and reliable information about the aliens, their nature, or to collect samples of their technology. Therefore, XCOM scientists were focused on theoretical solutions to complex problems in a variety of fields, from the natural sciences to military tactics. However, due to a dramatic decrease in funding and drastic staff reductions, all projects were eventually frozen. Now we have an opportunity to carry out some studies, but given the limited capacity, it is important to properly prioritize our efforts."
  STR_XCOM_SAMPLING: "Sample Сollection"
  STR_XCOM_SAMPLING_DESCRIPTION: "Usually, we are not able to get any traces of alien presence at suspected landing sites of their vessels. It is likely that the LHF agents who arrive at the location promptly clean up the area to prevent any information leakage. Thus, we are probably losing important, if not key, information about our enemy. Perhaps a sample collection kit should be developed that can be used when our soldiers are directly on the ground."
  STR_ADVANCED_WARFARE: "Advanced Warfare"
  STR_ADVANCED_WARFARE_UFOPEDIA: "The new reality that came after the official shutdown of the project dictates new tactics on the battlescape. The value of a well-trained soldier is tremendously increasing for us. The requirements for stealthy operations, the adoption of the Hit-and-Run behavior, impose severe limitations on the size of the squads we can deploy on missions. Under these conditions, we need to intensify the development and application of the most advanced technologies and methods of training soldiers to maximize the combat potential and versatility of a small unit of our fighters."
  STR_SOLDIER_SPECS: "Soldier Specializations"
  STR_SOLDIER_SPECS_UFOPEDIA: "Specialized training for X-COM soldiers can develop a variety of combat and tactical skills. After receiving their first promotion, each soldier can gain a specialty in one of several different areas. Successful completion of a specialty course not only improves a soldier's performance, but also gives them abilities appropriate to their specialty. A soldier can have only one specialization."
  STR_ADDITIONAL_COURSES: "Additional Courses"
  STR_ADDITIONAL_COURSES_UFOPEDIA: "We have developed several additional training courses for our soldiers:{NEWLINE}{ALT}*{ALT}Unarmed Combat{NEWLINE}{ALT}*{ALT}Rapid deployment{NEWLINE}These courses are available for soldiers and don't replace their specialization, but provide additional traits. In addition, we have developed a basic military training course for our non-combat personnel and agent training cource."
  STR_SUPPORT_DRONES: "Support Drones"
  STR_SUPPORT_DRONES_UFOPEDIA: "Remote-controlled robots and drones are an important component of assault squads, performing reconnaissance roles without exposing personnel to risk. In addition, drones can carry utility and small arms to support the squad. A drone unit consists of a command and control complex and the drone itself. The characteristics of the unit are made up of the characteristics of the control complex and the drone - by improving the drone models and control complexes, combining compatible models with each other we can achieve different combinations of characteristics. The drone is controlled and monitored by an officer from the base headquarters, our dropship provides relay functions. The availability and maximum number of drone control channels is specified in the craft specifications, it can be increased by installing additional systems.{NEWLINE}Obviously, we can't rely on commercial or military drones - their command channel could easily be compromised by our adversaries, which could jeopardize both the operation and our entire project. We need to design our own equipment and establish production."
  STR_DRONES_REMOTE_CONTROL: "Drone Control Systems"
  STR_DRONES_REMOTE_CONTROL_UFOPEDIA: "Remote control of a drone from the base is a non-trivial task, given the high requirements for secrecy, low latency, long distances and quality of transmitted video information. Obviously, a powerful transmitter cannot be installed on the drone itself, so the equipment on the landing craft will act as a retransmitter. Unfortunately, this scheme limits the use of drones to landing missions only, they cannot be used in covert operations. For communication between the ship and the base, we use a hacked high-speed channel of a low-orbit group of military satellites. Data in the channel is transmitted on dynamically changing frequencies, encryption keys are changed in a random interval from one to three minutes. The keys themselves and the interval of their change are transmitted to the craft directly from the base at low radio frequencies, which can be repeatedly reflected from the ionosphere and the earth, overcoming huge distances.{NEWLINE}This method is not suitable for the transfer of large amounts of data, but for the transfer of encryption keys, it is quite sufficient. Of course, the signal transmitted from the base is also encrypted, and the parameters for decryption are put into the ship's onboard computer before departure. Not all landing ships available to us have all the necessary equipment, so we have developed a modernization kit that can be connected to the ship's system."
  STR_DRONES_MANUFACTURING: "Drone Manufacturing"
  STR_DRONES_MANUFACTURING_UFOPEDIA: "We have sufficient resources to produce both the drones themselves, designed for direct support of assault troops, and remote control systems. For the basic model of the support drone, we have chosen a crawler chassis equipped with wide-angle and infrared cameras on a moving arm. The chassis has a modular design, in the expansion slot can be installed various additional equipment to perform more specific tasks and expand the combat application of the drone. By default, a manipulator capable of moving light objects is set as the utility slot."
  STR_FIREARMS_STUDY: "Firearms Study"
  STR_FIREARMS_STUDY_UFOPEDIA: "Almost from the very invention, firearms were the most effective infantry weapons. Modern small arms have approached their limit of practical effectiveness - since the late 70s, new models differ slightly from their predecessors in basic parameters. The marginal increase in one or more parameters requires a radical revision of the design and material of weapons and ammunition, as well as the introduction of innovative technologies. Such developments are underway in some countries, and the Ufopedia archives contain information about interesting super-secret developments. However, there were no own developments in this area."
  STR_SMART_WEAPONS: "Smart Weapons"
  STR_SMART_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "One of the most promising areas that can radically reduce the aiming time and accuracy is the development of the so-called 'Smart Weapons'. This concept implies the introduction of an advanced targeting system based on machine learning, automatic correction of the fire direction and the bullet's trajectory adjustment. The computer fire control system must perform all the necessary ballistic calculations on its own, allowing the soldier to focus on target designation and conduct tactical actions."
  STR_SMART_TARGETING: "Smart Targeting"
  STR_SMART_TARGETING_UFOPEDIA: "The advanced aiming system will include a multispectral camera complex located under the barrel, connected to the target recognition module. A set of images from cameras is analyzed taking into account the movement pattern, thermal signature, as well as insignia for recognition. The most important information for aiming is transmitted to a special display that occupies the place and functions of the scope. To analyze the image, we use an artificial neural network developed by us, the setting of the weights of which we will constantly adjust during the operation of Smart Weapons."
  STR_SMART_ROUNDS: "Smart Rounds"
  STR_SMART_ROUNDS_UFOPEDIA: "An innovative system of inertial trajectory  correction of the of a bullet fired from a rifled weapon has been developed. This is achieved by integrating a high-speed variable weight displacement mechanism into the bullet body, as well as a control unit. When passing through the barrel, trajectory correction parameters are entered into the control unit, which can be changed several times in flight. To do this, we have developed a miniature impulse  encrypted signal receiver. Corrections are used to compensate the target movement and wind gusts. The device is powered by thermoelectric conversion from the heat of a hot bullet and a microcondensor charged when the bullet is released. Due to the relatively lightweight microelectronics in the bullet body, a slight reduction in power compared to conventional rounds is inevitable."
  STR_SMART_WEAPONS_PRODUCTION: "Smart Weapons Production"
  STR_SMART_WEAPONS_PRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "A prototype has been developed and tested that combines innovative systems for aiming and controlling the trajectory of a bullet into an advance fire control system, compact and lightweight enough to be installed on a hand weapon without significantly reducing its operational properties. An important feature is the deflected design of the barrel inside the body of the weapon, which performs an 'aim assist', correcting the fire vector within 7 degrees from the longitudinal axis. Such a system has numerous moving parts and microelectronics, has sealed nodes, is expensive and difficult to utilize."
  STR_SMART_RIFLE: "Smart Rifle"
  STR_SMART_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "This rifle fully embodies the Smart Weapons concept for a radical increase of accuracy. An intelligent target acquisition and tracking system integrated with the sighting system. During the firing process, the rifle matches the direction of the barrel axis with vulnerable points on the enemy's body and provides 'aim assist'. The Smart Rounds programmer is installed at the end of the barrel before flame arrester."

However, our own research has been frozen and is at the very early stage of development."
  STR_ELECTRIC_WEAPONS_CONCEPT: "Electric Weapons Concept"
  STR_ELECTRIC_WEAPONS_CONCEPT_UFOPEDIA: "Given our serious lack of data on the adversary, it makes sense for us to try to capture enemy units alive if possible.

One of the most effective ways to render a living creature unconscious is to shock it with a strong electric shock. Perhaps we might try to develop our own electric weapons, which would be quite effective on battlescape."
  STR_LASER_WEAPONS_CONCEPT: "Laser Weapons Concept"
  STR_LASER_WEAPONS_CONCEPT_UFOPEDIA: "Laser weapons could have several major advantages over traditional weapons:{NEWLINE}{ALT}>{ALT}Laser beams propagate at the speed of light, so there is no need to account for target movement and no need to apply anticipation. In ground and air combat, it is impossible to evade laser beam irradiation.{NEWLINE}{ALT}>{ALT}The laser beam is not affected by the planet's gravity, making aiming easier.{NEWLINE}{ALT}>{ALT}The laser has configuration options for focusing the active area, which can be much smaller than the size of a firearm weapon's striking element. This can result in a much greater armor penetration.{NEWLINE}{ALT}>{ALT}The 'ammunition' of a laser depends solely on the energy source.{NEWLINE}{ALT}>{ALT}Since light has virtually zero energy impulse, the laser has no perceptible recoil, which has a very positive effect on the accuracy of such weapons.{NEWLINE}However, before we can effectively utilize laser weapons in tactical or aerial combat, there are some serious problems that must be solved:{NEWLINE}{ALT}>{ALT}The scattering effect causes the laser to lose focus and scatter energy in the atmosphere. The problem is dramatically exacerbated in conditions of fog, clouds, or smoke.{NEWLINE}{ALT}>{ALT}One of the major problems with laser weapons (as with any directed energy weapon) is their extreme power consumption."
  STR_ELECTROMAGNETIC_WEAPONS_CONCEPT: "Electromagnetic Weapons Concept"
  STR_ELECTROMAGNETIC_WEAPONS_CONCEPT_UFOPEDIA: "Electromagnetic weapons are based on the principle of projectile acceleration due to the magnetic field. The advantages of such weapons are obvious - extremely high initial velocity and energy of the projectile, which means superior armor penetration. The weapon has virtually no recoil, and the absence of moving parts increases durability. However, the main disadvantage of such weapons is the enormous energy expenditure to fire a shot. Existing prototypes have extremely low efficiency (rarely reaching 27%) due to the high electrical resistance of the system. That leads to a large amount of waste heat and the need to use massive batteries. The energy source need to be significantly increased so that it could be portable enough to provide energy comparable to or greater than conventional weapons."
  STR_ELECTROMAGNETIC_WEAPONS_PRODUCTION: "Electromagnetic Weapons Production"
  STR_ELECTROMAGNETIC_WEAPONS_PRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Our achievements in the development of portable power sources make it possible to realize the concept of a railgun as a hand-held weapon. The railgun consists of two parallel electrodes connected to a powerful DC power source. The projectile is placed between the electrodes, closing the electric circuit, and acquires acceleration due to the Ampere force acting on a closed conductor with current in its own magnetic field. The current pulse must be so powerful and short that the projectile does not have time to vaporize and disperse. {NEWLINE}Unfortunately, further development of electromagnetic handguns is severely limited. To radically increase the energy of the projectile requires the use of coil weapon, with current technology is not practical, because the energy loss is too great due to conductor electric resistance. Theoretically, this problem could be overcome if a high-temperature superconductor (a material with no electrical resistance at temperatures greatly above absolute zero) could be created."
  STR_SUPERCONDUCTIVITY_THEORY_PREREQ: STR_SUPERCONDUCTIVITY_THEORY_PREREQ
  STR_SUPERCONDUCTIVITY_THEORY: "Superconductivity Theory"
  STR_SUPERCONDUCTIVITY_THEORY_UFOPEDIA: "A superconductor is a material that under certain conditions has the property of zero electrical resistance. This means that electric current can flow through the superconductor without energy loss. The most common superconductor is niobium-titanium alloy, which has the properties of superconductivity at a temperature of about -263 C. This cooling of the material is achieved by using a massive cryogenic unit and liquefied helium. However, in recent years there have been new compounds that acquire superconductivity properties at higher temperatures as well, which could bring this technology closer to military applications. There are several areas of research into high-temperature superconductivity, the most promising of which is the development of ceramic superconductors. However, due to the lack of a reliable theoretical model explaining the nature of superconductivity in materials above absolute zero and all the associated quantum effects. The search for a practical solution is more like looking for a needle in a haystack in total darkness."
  STR_LOOKING_FOR_HIGHT_TEMP_SUPERCONDUCTOR: "High-temperature Superconductor"
  STR_CERAMIC_SUPERCONDUCTOR: "Ceramic Superconductors"
  STR_CERAMIC_SUPERCONDUCTOR_UFOPEDIA: "Promising results of previous studies were obtained for a material based on copper oxide, in the layered structure of which thallium, barium and calcium oxides were added. The alternation of layers leads to stabilization of electron flow along the crystal structure. Unfortunately, it was not possible to achieve the transition of the material to the state of superconductivity at temperatures above -150 C, which, although higher than the temperature of liquid nitrogen (which greatly simplifies the design of cryogenic installation), but still makes it impractical for use in the design of advanced weapons. In addition, a critical disadvantage of this material is that at high voltage of the current flowing leads to the destruction of the intrinsic layered structure of the conductor and, consequently, irreversible loss of superconducting properties."
  STR_IRON_BASED_SUPERCONDUCTOR: "Iron-based Superconductors"
  STR_IRON_BASED_SUPERCONDUCTOR_UFOPEDIA: "Superconductivity occurs in various iron pnictide compounds starting at temperatures as low as -250 C. They also have high electron density and good conductivity, making them potentially useful for electronic devices. During the transition to the superconducting state, each zone opens its own slit in the quasiparticle spectrum, leading to at least two superconducting condensates and multi-slit superconductivity. A huge number of combinations of alloys of iron and chalcogens with other elements have been investigated, but so could not come close to creating a practical to use high-temperature superconductor. For example, an alloy with barium and cobalt showed superconductivity at a magnetic field strength of 43 tesla and at a pressure of more than 4 GPa. Such enormous conditions are difficult to reproduce even in the laboratory, and the use in weapons can not even be thought of. Under normal conditions, the best result was obtained for the alloy with samarium at temperatures below -218 C."
  STR_CARBON_SUPERCONDUCTOR: "Carbon Superconductors"
  STR_CARBON_SUPERCONDUCTOR_UFOPEDIA: "Graphene is a material consisting of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a lattice of hexagons. It has unique electronic properties such as high electron mobility and high conductivity. In the layered structure of graphene, superconductivity is only observed at temperatures near absolute zero. However, most of the physical properties of graphene depend on the nanostructure of its molecules, so a number of special studies have been conducted to analyze the relationship of different structures of graphene, as well as experiments to add impurities of other elements to the crystal structure. When ligating 3 atoms of cesium on the fuhlerene molecule allows achieving the effect of superconductivity at a temperature of -233 C and at a pressure of 100 Pa. With increasing pressure, the critical temperature rises, but the dependence has a nonlinear character. Alas, but even at a pressure of several gigapascals, the substance acquires superconductivity at temperatures below -180 C."
  STR_HYDRID_SUPERCONDUCTOR: "Hydride Alloys Superconductors"
  STR_HYDRID_SUPERCONDUCTOR_UFOPEDIA: Thanks to predictions from sophisticated computer modeling, superconductivity has been found in a spectrum of complex hydrides - compounds of metals with numerous hydrogen atoms. Thus, lanthanum hydride exhibits superconductor properties at -46 C, yttrium hydride at -30 C. Alas, the superconductivity of these substances comes only at a pressure of more than 200 GPa (several million atmosphere pressure), which makes the results of these studies interesting from the point of view of theory, but absolutely useless from the point of view of practice. Experiments with heavy isotopes of hydrogen also at the beginning seemed promising, but in the end even the use of precious tritium in hydride alloy does not allow achieving confident superconductivity at pressures below 100 GPa. Such pressure is impossible to obtain outside of special diamond presses, so there are no prospects for creating portable devices with superconductors based on hydride alloys."
  STR_SUPERCONDUCTOR_QUANTUM_MODEL: "Quantum Theory of High-temperature Superconductivity."
  STR_SUPERCONDUCTOR_QUANTUM_MODEL_UFOPEDIA: "The key to finding a high-temperature superconductor lies in understanding the mechanism of superconductivity origin at the quantum level. Unfortunately, none of the traditional techniques of condensed matter physics have ever been designed to solve a problem like this. The new mathematical model is based on the understanding of the quantum fluctuation mechanism, which leads to the bundling of electrons into a quasi-mechanical structure and begins to manifest its properties at the macro-level. Such a connected chain of electrons has zero momentum, and energy is transferred due to phonon oscillations. Thermal fluctuations of the conductor molecules above a certain value disrupt this structure, so the properties of the superconductor disappear at high temperatures and low pressure."
  STR_SUPERCONDUCTOR: "Palladium  Superconductor"
  STR_SUPERCONDUCTOR_UFOPEDIA: "Thanks to our achievements in developing a model of spin fluctuations, we were able to simulate the formation of a bonded electron chain in the hexagonal crystal lattice of palladium oxide when cerium, iridium, and polonium atoms are added to it. The flow of electrons forms a spiral, which passes at a sufficient distance from the atoms of the crystal lattice in order to minimize their interaction. In this case, the temperature fluctuations of the atoms of the crystal lattice are harmonized with the fluctuations of the spiral bound electrons, without disrupting it at sufficiently high temperatures and low pressure. The experiments confirmed the theoretical calculations - superconductivity is preserved at temperatures below -56 C and pressure above 450 KPa with the passage of a virtually unlimited electric current. Despite the costliness of the resulting alloy, almost 'room' conditions of the resulting superconductor will allow us to effectively use it in a variety of applications."
  STR_COIL_WEAPONS: "Coil Weapons"
  STR_COIL_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA:  "Breakthroughs in the development of high-temperature superconductors, capacitors and batteries enable us to develop an effective small arms weapon based on the Gauss gun principle. The Gauss gun consists of a solenoid with a barrel (usually made of dielectric material) inside. A projectile made of ferromagnetic material is inserted into one end of the barrel. When an electric current flows in the solenoid, an electromagnetic field is generated which accelerates the projectile, 'pulling' it inside the solenoid. For the greatest effect, the current pulse in the solenoid must be short and powerful. Previously created prototypes had extremely poor efficiency (only up to 7% of the capacitor's energy was transferred to the projectile), so they needed a massive power input. We approached the problem radically and comprehensively, our prototype due to the use of palladium superconductor in solenoids and ultra-dense capacitors as power surge has an efficiency of up to 78%, the projectile released by it has a muzzle energy of 1 953 J and muzzle velocity of 940 m/s. At the same time, a unit capable of firing 5 projectiles can be freely held in the hands of our scientists! These are amazing results, and we are ready to start designing serial samples."
  STR_COIL_PISTOL: "Coil Pistol"
  STR_COIL_PISTOL_CLIP: "Coil Pistol Clip"
  STR_COIL_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "The Coil Pistol's miniaturized design and low number of metal parts allow it to be carried concealed. The three stages of acceleration and the increased mass of the charge allow transferring enough energy to the charge, but not to accelerate it above the speed of sound. In this way, no sonic shock wave is created and the noise from the shot is minimized."
  STR_COIL_RIFLE: "Coil Rifle"
  STR_COIL_RIFLE_CLIP: "Coil Rifle Clip"
  STR_COIL_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "The Coil Rifle is optimized for mid-range combat and assault actions. The casing and most parts are made of durable polymer. Five acceleration stages transfer an impressive amount of energy to the projectile, while the cooling system allows for short burst firing. The projectiles have supersonic velocity, so despite the absence of noise from expanding powder gases and moving elements of the rifle, the shock waves from the projectiles flying out of the muzzle of the rifle are capable of exposing the shooter."
  STR_COIL_SNIPER_RIFLE: "Coil Sniper Rifle"
  STR_COIL_SNIPER_RIFLE_CLIP: "Coil Sniper Rifle Clip"
  STR_COIL_SNIPER_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "Further development of the coil weapon concept, aimed at increasing accuracy and range of fire, as well as increasing armor penetration parameters. Eight acceleration stages give a quite massive charge made of iron and tungsten alloy a velocity almost six times the speed of sound."
  STR_COIL_CANNON: "Coil Cannon"
  STR_COIL_CANNON_CLIP: "Coil Cannon Clip"
  STR_COIL_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "A special system of nested solenoids was developed for the heavy Coil Cannon to provide continuous powerful acceleration of the massive projectile with a tungsten core. As a result, it was possible to reduce the size of the device to an acceptable size from the point of view of usability. The energy produced by this hand-held weapon can be comparable to analogs mounted on modern light tanks."
  STR_LASER_SCATTERING_PROBLEM: "Laser Scattering Problem"
  STR_LASER_SCATTERING_PROBLEM_UFOPEDIA: "Laser beams begin to cause plasma breakdown in the atmosphere at an energy density of about one megajoule per cubic centimeter. This effect, called 'blooming,' causes the laser to defocus and disperse energy into the surrounding air. Blooming can be more severe if there is fog, smoke, dust, rain, snow, smog, or foam in the air. Methods to reduce these effects include:{NEWLINE}{ALT}>{ALT}Spreading the beam through a large, curved mirror that focuses the power on the target so that the energy density along the path is too low to cause a bloom. This requires a large, very precise, fragile mirror mounted like a searchlight and cumbersome equipment to rotate the mirror to aim the laser, making such a solution inapplicable to tactical or aircraft weapons.{NEWLINE}{ALT}>{ALT}Use of a phased array. For typical laser wavelengths, this method would require billions of micrometer-sized antennas. There is currently no known way to realize them, although carbon nanotubes have been proposed.{NEWLINE}{ALT}>{ALT}Using a phase-conjugate laser system. This method employs a 'guide' laser illuminating the target. Any mirror-like ('specular') points on the target reflect light that is sensed by the weapon's primary amplifier. The weapon then amplifies inverted waves, in a positive feedback loop, destroying the target, with shockwaves as the specular regions evaporate. This avoids blooming because the waves from the target pass through the blooming, and therefore show the most conductive optical path; this automatically corrects for the distortions caused by blooming. Experimental systems using this method usually use special chemicals to form a 'phase-conjugate mirror'. However, such mirror overheats dramatically at weapon-useful power levels.{NEWLINE}{ALT}>{ALT}Using a very short pulse ending before blooming creates interference, but it requires a very powerful laser to concentrate a tremendous amount of energy into that pulse, which does not exist in a form suitable for weapon use."
  STR_PULSE_LASER: "Pulse Laser"
  STR_PULSE_LASER_UFOPEDIA: "Advanced alien tech requierd"
  STR_PHASE_LASER: "Phase-Conjugate Laser"
  STR_PHASE_LASER_UFOPEDIA: "We have focused our efforts on developing the theory of a phase-conjugate laser system (we call it a 'phaser' for short). Experimental work has confirmed that the produced positive feedback loop by wavefront reverse avoids blooming, but causes significant damage focused on a tiny area. Almost any surface, even very hard materials, can be destroyed, while the energy consumption remains acceptable.{NEWLINE}Overheating of the phase mirror, however, remains a major problem. Optimization of the molecular structure of the mirror surface requires significant theoretical research in the field of nonlinear optics."
  STR_NON_LINEAR_OPTICS: "Non-Linear Optics Theory"
  STR_NON_LINEAR_OPTICS_UFOPEDIA: "We managed to develop a new method of creating mirrors for lasers using advanced nonlinear optics theory. By using nonlinear optical processes, it is possible to precisely change the direction of propagation and phase change of the light beam. The new material obtained by sputtering titanium and cobalt ions onto gold amalgam in an inert xenon environment under a strong alternating magnetic field has amazing properties.{NEWLINE}Essentially, it allows you to change the properties of light when exposed to other light. Thanks to this, it was possible to create a mirror that reflects light with the highest efficiency and does not allow its scattering.{NEWLINE}However, practical applications are complicated by the extreme heating of the mirror when used in a phase-matching laser."
  STR_PHASER_MIRROR: "Phaser Mirror"
  STR_PHASER_MIRROR_UFOPEDIA: "Using our knowledge of advanced materials, we selected the design parameters of the phase reflector so that it could function under a powerful load (in the form of an effective arms weapon), but without reaching the vaporization temperature of the mirror surface. {NEWLINE}Heat dissipation can be carried out through layers of graphene, if it is possible to preserve its strict 2-D structure during sputtering. The surface thus created will have a huge dissipation area from which heat can be removed by more conventional heat sinks. The mirror can be mounted using aerogel to prevent heat transfer to the rest of the weapon structure."
  STR_PHASER_TARGETTING_SYSTEM: "Phaser Targetting System"
  STR_PHASER_TARGETTING_SYSTEM_UFOPEDIA: "Practical application of phase-conjugate laser system in tactical combat environments requires the development of a fundamentally new targeting system. The primary laser beam must be reflected from the target onto the laser mirror for repeated nonlinear amplification, resulting in the formation of 'shock waves' of electromagnetic radiation with a specific spectrum that destroys the target.{NEWLINE}Finding the efficient reflection point on the target, as well as adjusting the target designation under conditions of turbulent air distortion, must be accomplished in microseconds. Using the latest developments in deep machine learning has allowed us to create a unique targeting computer system for our phased weapons."
  STR_PHASERS_PRODUCTION: "Phasers Production"
  STR_PHASERS_PRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Recent breakthroughs in the field of advanced optics, as well as gained knowledge about innovative materials and computer technologies, have allowed us to approach the application of laser weapons in the form of hand-held weapons, which can be considered as an alternative to standard ballistic weapons.{NEWLINE}Having focused on the development of technological processes, taking into account our current production capabilities, we can now safely say that for the production of effective weapons. We need the last steps - the development of a prototype and setup of serial production."

It is unlikely that we would have been able to access this data so extensively from other sources, as we've been cut from support from the Council and world governments who probably do not know that we still exist.

  STR_COMMUNICATION_UFOPEDIA: "Most of the old government communication channels are no longer available to us, the rest are probably controlled by alien agents. Centralized use of direct radio links, even if encrypted, is not reasonable either - our enemies will be able to track the source of the signals and destroy it. Fortunately, we live in an age of booming decentralized computer networks! By hacking hundreds of thousands of personal computers online, our IT specialists have deployed an entire system of sophisticated proxy servers. Our encrypted messages are embedded in massive data flows and mixed with a vast amount of false messages being sent. Meanwhile, any attempt to track or intercept our traffic will immediately be detected and the data will be securely rerouted to another path, potentially enveloping the entire planet." #Onion routing FTW! -D
  STR_BASE_DEFENSE_COMBAT_ANALYSIS: "Base Defense Tactical Analysis"
  STR_BASE_DEFENSE_COMBAT_ANALYSIS_UFOPEDIA: "Tactical analysis of the recent assault on our base has exposed several significant security vulnerabilities. Although most of the complex is underground, some of its modules have a direct connection to the surface. The obvious point of enemy penetration into the base is the entry lift. In addition, our aircraft perform vertical take-off from the hangars. Despite our attempts to disguise the closing casements of our hangars they can still be easily detected from the ground. Enemies blasted a few holes in the casements and went down on ropes inside. There is a good chance that our enemies will use the hangars to break into the base in the future as well. Unfortunately, these circumstances were not taken into account in the initial base design, and now we need to think about how to improve the defense systems, and also to pay more attention to the base layout."
  STR_COVERT_OPERATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "Due to the clear dominance of our enemy, the preferred strategy will be keeping a low profile when dealing with important strategic tasks. We can send our agents to covert operations for more subtle methods of solving a problem than an open attack. The secure channels we've developed allow us to coordinate agents remotely, and for some operations, it is also important to involve scientists for analytical work and engineers to design the special gear. A covert operation is always a risk, and in order to increase your success odds you should be careful when choosing your team and equipment. Any little thing, in the end, can play a key role."
  STR_INTELLIGENCE: "Intelligence"
  STR_INTELLIGENCE_UFOPEDIA: "We have a wealth of experience in a variety of intelligence activities. When you get a new lead, you may assign one or more agents to a new intel project and in the process it may lead to the discovery of new opportunities: missions for our operatives, assistance in covert operations, and surveillance of enemy activity, depending on the specific project's purpose. Captives seized during an encounter are placed in a prison where our agents can interrogate them, which can provide us with crucial information. If humane interrogation techniques aren't helpful, harsher interrogation methods can be used. In addition, some prisoners may be attempted to be recruited, which can give us a valuable asset."
  STR_MONSTER_HUNT_START: "Strange creatures"
  STR_MONSTER_HUNT_START_UFOPEDIA: "We have collected cross-referenced data pointing to paranormal phenomena localized in the forests of northern Illinois, USA. Cases of mysterious disappearances of people and domestic animals have been reported in this region. Local authorities have investigated cases and even involved the FBI, but as far as we know, these actions have not yielded significant results. Our soldiers can pretend to be federal agents conducting another investigation to avoid attracting attention."
  STR_MONSTER_HUNT_RUMORS_ANALYSIS: "Monsters Activity Analysis"
  STR_MONSTER_HUNT_RUMORS_ANALYSIS_UFOPEDIA: "The fragmentary data collected by our field agents after careful analysis and comparison with Ufopaedia archival files has finally allowed us to make progress in our investigation. We are constantly one step behind, some practical actions need to be taken to detect the activity of the mysterious monsters in a timely manner. Then we could send our people on a hunt for one of these creatures."
  STR_MONSTER_HUNT_RUMORS: "Monster Rumors"
  STR_MONSTER_HUNT_RUMORS_DESCRIPTION: "Commander! We have just acquired a report from our alert system about an incident with mysterious monsters! We should send our agents to investigate it as quickly as possible, with a new covert operation planned.{NEWLINE}{ALT}New covert operation available."
  STR_MONSTER_HUNT_RUMORS_UFOPEDIA: "We managed to expand the number of information channels through which we receive information concerning the activity of unknown monsters that are contacting civilians. Based on machine learning algorithms, a huge amount of various information is analyzed, and we are able to get timely information about the location of a new incident. Thus, we will be able to send a squad of our agents there and conduct a 'hot pursuit' investigation, and ideally - try to capture one of those creatures for further study. The first reports will be available shortly."
  STR_ZOMBIE_PARASITE: "Zombie Parasite"
  STR_ZOMBIE_PARASITE_UFOPEDIA: "The creature enters the victim's body through the mouth, settling in the stomach. There, it releases a huge amount of toxins and complex proteins, which has the extreme effect on the endocrine system, completely reorganizing it. The victim stops feeling pain, the blood becomes thick and clots very quickly, and the tissues regenerate at an astonishing rate. Muscle tone and neurotransmission are increased, and the immune system is almost completely suppressed. At the same time, the parasite, using its tail, pierces the stomach wall and wraps the spine with thin long outgrowths similar to tourniquets. They penetrate between the vertebrae and connect to the spinal cord. The longest spurs run along the cervical spine and penetrate the cerebellum. Then, along the inner surface of the skull, the flagella connect to the occipital and parietal lobes. In fact, the nervous system of the parasite connects with the nervous system of the victim. The frontal lobe, responsible for consciousness, becomes almost inactive, and its functions are mainly taken over by the small brain of the parasite."
  STR_ZOMBIE_BIOLOGY: "Zombie Biology"
  STR_ZOMBIE_BIOLOGY_UFOPEDIA: "Since zombie parasite has no heart of its own, the final stage of transformation involves integration into the victim's circulatory system. The body of the parasite has special cavities containing significant amounts of stabilized adenosine triphosphoric acid, which is the main source of energy for the cells of all living organisms. Apparently, the parasite uses these energy surge to fuel the host body for a initial period after transformation. It is unclear how the zombies obtain energy once these reserves are depleted, as the digestive system is almost completely destroyed during the transformation process. We have not been able to reproduce the process of synthesizing stable ATA. However, we can conclude that the extracted and refined body contents of the parasite can be safely used by our soldiers on a mission as an extremely efficient energy booster."
  STR_ZOMBIE_SOURCE: "Zombie Proliferation Source"
  STR_ZOMBIE_SOURCE_UFOPEDIA: "The zombie parasite life cycle is not enclosed - we see no evidence of them reproducing inside zombie bodies and where new facehuggers carrying the zombie parasite come from. We analyzed DNA samples from the parasites and facehuggers and realized that these organisms are being cloned. In doing so, they are apparently grown independently and surgically fused as adults. The only explanation for our findings and how well the parasite is biologically tailored to human zombification is that this living organism was artificially designed. The containers we collected from the sites of alleged UFO landings most likely served to carry facehuggers. Released, they attack people and turn them into zombies. The short lifespan of zombies and the absence of a visible way to independently increase their numbers makes the goals pursued by aliens unobvious. Our main hypothesis at the moment is to conduct experiments."
  STR_ZOMBIE_AGENDA: "Zombier Agenda"
  STR_ZOMBIE_AGENDA_UFOPEDIA: "It was not clear why the zombie parasite penetrates into the areas of the victim's brain responsible for long-term memory. Our simulations of the processes occurring in the nervous system of the victim and the parasite during zombification and our knowledge of the nature of psionics and the alien psionic network have led us to terrifying conclusions. During zombification, the parasite uses the victim's brain as an analogue of an antenna in the psionic field, temporarily connecting to the alien psionic network. In doing so, it 'uploads' some of the victim's memories into the network. Thus, zombification can be used by aliens to gather intelligence on their enemies. For example, it explains zombie attacks on Resistance facilities."
  STR_RESISTANCE_CONTACT: "Contact with the Resistance"
  STR_RESISTANCE_CONTACT_DESCRIPTION: "We need to make contact with the scattered Resistance cells scattered around the world. It's probable that our adversaries are also looking for them, so we can't rule out a combat engagement. However, the main purpose of this operation is covert investigation, so heavy equipment will hinder our agents."
  STR_RESISTANCE_CONTACT_UFOPEDIA: "The Resistance is a voluntary union of people not willing to obey the new world regime. This initiative began to emerge in the early '70s and in the beginning, consisted of ufologists and conspiracy theorists. Who could ever guess that they would be in the right? In the past few years, the Resistance began to be joined by a large number of very different people - scientists, journalists, doctors, ordinary people, and even former military officers. They all had one thing in common - they had somehow come into contact with the aliens and now Men in Black are hunting them down. Most of those who have discovered even a little about the aliens after a very short time have disappeared under mysterious and often frightening circumstances. The rest learn to hide well and form guerrilla cells around the world. The goal of the Resistance is to unite and protect these disparate groups, reveal the mysterious plans of the invaders, and consolidate all mankind against an extraterrestrial threat."

  STR_STARTING_EQUIPMENT_UFOPEDIA: "Since the X-COM project was discontinued, we have lost our regular armament and gear suppliers. But we continue to fight, and we vitally need new sources of weaponry and ammunition. Maybe our new friends can help out with that? Regrettably, lacking established illegal arms channels, they can only offer us weapons that are available for purchase by civilians. Our contact in the Resistance transferred the tactical specifications of the items we can buy from them, all information analyzed and uploaded to Ufopedia."
  STR_SUPPLIES: "Supplies"
  STR_SUPPLIES_UFOPEDIA: "In the current circumstances we must act as carefully as possible to avoid unnecessary attention to ourselves. Fortunately, in many aspects our base is autonomous - we have a source of drinking water and electricity generators. We have developed a system by which we can organize safe purchases of food and basic supplies, and some simple spare parts in several nearby cities. We've had major funding issues for a long time, so we're already left with people who put the fight against aliens ahead of taking care of their personal earnings. We've resigned contracts with all the staff, all of them willing to continue working on the project voluntarily, as long as we take care of providing them with everything they need to work, and it would be good to keep the morale high."
  STR_NON_LETHAL_EQUIPMENT: "Non-Lethal Weapons"
  STR_NON_LETHAL_EQUIPMENT_UFOPEDIA: "In the past, we have envisioned fighting aliens and their agents with lethal weapons. Captured alive enemies can be a valuable resource, with the help of which we can get critical information. It is not difficult to stun an enemy - it is enough to deliver a powerful blow to a certain area of the head without damaging the skull. An alternative is an electric jolt that shocks the nervous system. Tactical information about known non-lethal weapons has been added to the Ufopaedia database. Unfortunately, they have limited effectiveness in intense combat. Perhaps our engineers can create more powerful devices."
  STR_SEALED_CRATE_BREACHING: "Assets sealed"
  STR_SEALED_CRATE_BREACHING_UFOPEDIA: "During the initiation of the Oblivion protocol, the containers that held a large amount of our gear and equipment were sealed.

  STR_IMPROVISED_MANUFACTURING_UFOPEDIA: "We have designed technological processes for the manufacture of a wide variety of items from common materials. Special attention was paid to the fact that all purchases of machine tools and other equipment could be made without attracting unnecessary attention and were widely available. We established a list of suppliers who would be able to provide the necessary equipment and raw materials. It is necessary to send our agents to sign agreements with them. At the same time, of course, it is necessary to create a network of false confidants who will disguise the supplies from possible disclosure of these schemes by our adversaries."

We have also been able to develop designs for simple support grenades that do not require sophisticated equipment. Although they are less effective than combat grenades, our designs can be useful in resource-limited settings.{NEWLINE}Let me know if you need some spare grenades!"
  STR_IMPROVISED_SMOKE_GRENADE_TINKERING_DESCRIPTION: "Obviously, we need to restock our support grenades to be able to cover our soldiers in a critical situation from enemy fire. We have developed designs for a simple smoke grenade, which can be produced without special equipment."

  STR_HIGH_TECH_MANUFACTURING_POSTREQ: STR_HIGH_TECH_MANUFACTURING_POSTREQ
  STR_HIGH_TECH_MANUFACTURING_UFOPEDIA: "Recently, governments of many countries have been introducing measures to control the production and circulation of high-tech components and microelectronics. The reasons for this are not obvious to us; perhaps it is related to the increasing international tensions. Nevertheless, in order to further develop our production capabilities, we need a constant and reliable source of microelectronics components. In addition, for in-house electronics manufacturing, we need to acquire a number of specific equipment, which can hardly be done easily without attracting undue attention. We have several possible options, and we have prepared a plan for another covert operation."
  STR_LOYALTY: "Loyalty"
  STR_LOYALTY_UFOPEDIA: "The X-COM Project was officially shut down and now we can only count on ourselves. The loss of the Council's support is a severe blow to our organization but despite all hard circumstances our people are determined to fight against alien invaders at all costs. 'Ad victoriam' - that's our new motto! Today isn't money determining our future, but how strong our men's spirit is. It is essential not to let the morale go down and there are many points of influence on it. The successful operations against our adversaries, major scientific and technological breakthroughs, and progress towards understanding the nature of our enemies, - all these factors will significantly raise the morale and bring the team together, that's why we should be extremely careful and wise in our strategic and tactical choices."

I am incredibly pleased that the X-Com project has survived the recent tragic events and hope that you are able to continue the fight against the alien invasion. Until recently, I was a member of the Council of Funding Nations and was an adamant supporter of the project for a long time. I believe alien agents have infiltrated the Council itself, which should explain the radical change of its activities. I need your help to investigate these insidious intrigues. I will transmit the details of the mission through a secure channel."

  STR_RESISTANCE_STARTING_EQUIPMENT_UFOPEDIA: "Establishing ties with the Resistance has paid off - now we can buy from them some weapons and equipment for our needs! Of course, these guys would be happy to help us completely free of charge, but it should be understood that it's not so easy to get anything, so we must compensate some associated costs with proportional amount of money. Of course, the equipment we are purchasing is far from cutting-edge technology, but at least it will allow us to maintain the average combat capability of our agents and be ready to conduct various operations."
  STR_RESISTANCE_BASIC_EQUIPMENT: "Resistance Military Equipment"
  STR_RESISTANCE_BASIC_EQUIPMENT_UFOPEDIA: "Now the Resistance is ready to secretly supply us with military-grade weapons and equipment. We should maintain good relations with them, it is unlikely that they will sell guns to foes. It is also possible that they will want to keep some items for themselves.

  STR_EXPANDABLE_AMMO: "Expansive Ammunition"
  STR_EXPANDABLE_AMMO_UFOPEDIA: "Expansive bullets are designed to significantly increase their diameter when hitting soft tissue in order to increase their lethality. This is achieved by increasing the softness of the metal from which the bullet is made, as well as the cavity at the apex. At the same time, this makes it significantly less effective against even lightly armored targets.{NEWLINE}Such ammunition is forbidden for use by the military and is used mainly for hunting, so it was not part of the standard X-COM ammunition."
  STR_ADVANCED_COOLING_SYSTEMS: "Advanced Cooling Systems"
  STR_ADVANCED_COOLING_SYSTEMS_UFOPEDIA: "Further development of high-energy weapons requires the development of new systems for dissipation of waste heat generated by the weapon during firing. At the same time, the systems realized for handguns should be relatively light, compact, reliable and resistant to damage. We have developed a number of solutions that we can now apply in various configurations when designing weapon systems. We can achieve the best performance with phase-change cooling using helium. By vaporizing from the heat sink, helium can reduce its temperature to -150 °C. The expanding gas flows into the compressor, which is equipped with highly efficient copper heat sinks with active cooling. To compensate for impulse loads, a system of liquefied helium injection into a circuit of thermostatic vacuum capsules is provided, and excess heat is removed through an additional circuit with a cascade evaporator that ejects part of the superheated helium into the atmosphere."
  STR_HIGH_DENSITY_CAPACITORS: "High-density Capacitors"
  STR_HIGH_DENSITY_CAPACITORS_UFOPEDIA: "After reviewing prospective research in the field of capacitor production, we came to the conclusion that aluminum electrolytic capacitors could be suitable for powering our weapon systems, as they have the right set of properties for us - high maximum charge and specific power. Due to their short self-discharge time, weapons based on them should be stored discharged and charged just before combat. For the electrolyte we will use a complex organic compound developed by us - carboxamide with a tantalum as a radical."
  STR_ULTRA_DENSE_CAPACITORS: "Ultra-dense Capacitors"
  STR_ULTRA_DENSE_CAPACITORS_UFOPEDIA: "A high-energy weapon requires a pulsed surge of extremely high power to fire a shot. In addition, the high power density of the battery is impractical in terms of possible damage to the battery in combat. We developed the concept of supercapacitors using rubidium isotope oxide as an electrode and calcium niobate ion as a dielectric. In this case, the thickness of the capacitor does not exceed 30 microns. Clusters of such supercapacitors are capable of producing a current pulse of previously unseen density."
  STR_ADVANCED_BATTERIES: "Advanced Batteries"
  STR_ADVANCED_BATTERIES_UFOPEDIA: "Advanced battery technology is based on the use of lithium polymer cells. Having analyzed modern research in this field, we have selected the formula of a synthetic polymer compound with optimal properties for use as an electrolyte. By adding titanium oxide to a solution of terephthalic acid by chain polymerization and irradiating it with X-rays, we have obtained a composition for a high power lithium battery."
  STR_HIGH_PERFORMANCE_BATTERIES: "High-performance Batteries"
  STR_HIGH_PERFORMANCE_BATTERIES_UFOPEDIA: "Further development of lithium batteries to increase energy density is limited, and in search of a solution, an attempt to improve the design of ionister-pseudocapacitor was made. Electrodes made of carbon nanotubes with iron nanoparticles inserted in them are placed in a solution of lead sulfate and hydrochloric acid as an electrolyte. The resulting double electric layer allows electrons to pass through at a tremendous speed by creating a tunneling effect. The resulting material in combination with an electrolyte can store an enormous electrical charge. Despite the significant difficulties in manufacturing such batteries, we have developed an electrochemical process for treating pure carbon with potassium hydroxide."

The first is the analysis of acid composition used in it and development of the reproduction method for this solution.

This is an incredibly aggressive compound with high corrosive properties. In contact with oxygen, it decomposes quite quickly into very toxic components, each aggressive to various types of surfaces, to which the composition lands. This results in an extremely effective weapon with a wide range of applications. The structural properties of this acid molecule are striking in their elegance. It is not easy to synthesize it, but our scientists have managed to develop a fairly straightforward process so that production can begin."

Until then, such incidents were not investigated because of the war, and before that the military did not have a sufficiently reliable way of detecting flying objects. The conditions of the Cold War, namely the active scanning of NATO and Soviet airspace, the development of detection technology and mutual mistrust actively contributed to the investigation of UFO activity in different countries.{NEWLINE}In 1984, an unsuccessful endeavor was made to create a secret intergovernmental committee at the UN, designed to unite the efforts of different countries. In 1996 a second attempt was made to create a supranational secret organization dedicated to investigating alien activity on Earth, called X-COM. Funding was supposed to come from a covert group of influential politicians and military officers from various countries named The Council.{NEWLINE}*** New entry ***{NEWLINE}On March 5, 1999, X-COM was disbanded.{NEWLINE}*** Confirm saving a new entry?

In all that time, not once did it manage to shoot down an alien vessel. Twice a group of soldiers was dispatched to a UFO landing site, but both times contact with the squad broke off a few minutes after disembarkation. The soldiers relayed that they had made contact with the enemy, suffering casualties from some sort of energy weapon. The alien armor and some sort of force shields proved extremely effective against standard weapons. Because of the former commander's poor performance and controversial decisions, several members resigned from the council.

Often the discovery of the circles is accompanied by the appearance of men in black suits posing as government agents. They cordon off the scene, but give no intelligible explanation to the locals. At the end of the 90s, a persistent refutation of all conspiracy theories related to crop circles emerged. According to this interpretation, the authors of the crop circles are a community of people who, as a joke or for advertising purposes, trample crop circles at night with a simple device made of a wooden board and rope."

Examination of network infrastructure data segments revealed that the command center servers maintained minimal communication with the outside world. The only means of information transmission were satellite dishes on the roof of the building, but no information was transmitted from the facility. This isolation was probably necessary to maximize the secrecy of the site. This container functioned as a kind of ark, designed to preserve data in case the command center was destroyed. Unfortunately, the recording process was interrupted and much of the data was corrupted. Nevertheless, we found an extensive set of data related to the X-COM project, including the coordinates of our European base and information about the M.I.B. attack on it. We can assume that this data was intended to be transmitted to another M.I.B. headquarters, but it was not. Therefore, we can say with a high degree of certainty that the M.I.B. no longer have information about our location."

Serious detoxification of the body and manifestations of withdrawal syndrome began. We managed to stabilize the physical condition of the subject, but the mental condition remained fairly grave - acute psychosis, persecution mania and hallucinations were observed. The last thing the subject can remember is that he went out in the evening to buy vodka. A face-to-face database search resulted in an 87% match to a case fitting his described background. The Russian Interior Ministry database contains information about a missing locksmith who worked at the Tver (Central Russia) machine building factory. The report includes his wife's testimony, saying that he went out late at night to buy groceries at a store nearby 6 years ago, but never came back. We also ran a check on his spouse - she remarried 4 months after the incident."

However, standard interrogation methods yielded no valuable information; the subject remembers absolutely nothing about what happened to him over the past 5 years. It was decided to try hypnosis as a last resort and to our surprise it went quite well and the subject even remembered some interesting details:{NEWLINE}'It's night, I'm standing in a forest glade, holding a man I don't know by his expensive tie, with a gun pointed to the back of his head. Next to me stands my partner, dressed in a black, austere suit, his sleeves stained with blood. We're waiting for someone to come, and then a light becomes apparent among the trees. It's the one we've been waiting for.'{NEWLINE}At that moment, however, the subject clutched his head, screamed something incoherent, and convulsed.

Alas, this did not yield the desired result - as with other M.I.B. agents, the subject remembered nothing about this mysterious organization. We decided to take a risk and inject him with 'truth serum' - a strong psychotropic substance used in interrogations. It was a big risk, considering what crazy cocktail was in his blood just recently. Even so, the subject responded well to the injection, and even remembered a few things:{NEWLINE}'I'm driving a black minivan, pulling into the grounds of a big office complex. I pass the parking area and drive around the main building. On the opposite side there is a gate... and ... Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh'.{NEWLINE}The subject clutched his head, started screaming and wriggling, foam coming out of his mouth.

I got to his booth and... and... Shit, and then I'm here! Where's Stevie?! What's wrong with him?! Let me go!!!' The subject broke free and tried to escape, we had to administer an extra dose of sedative, but it seemed to be incompatible with the substances his captors were drugging him with, and after half an hour the agony began.

However, it was noticeable that he was trying to hide something. We applied hypnosis, which revealed that the subject was on his way to a date with a woman he had met in the city library the day before. He was trying to hide this information because he had a wife and two children. We checked police records, the family filed a wanted notice 7 months ago. We were unable to find out any other essential details."

  STR_FRESH_MIB_AGENT_UFOPEDIA: "Surprisingly, the subject endured the detox relatively easily, and our therapy was very effective. Soon he was ready for interrogation. Sadly, the drugs they give him suppress his memory very well, so he remembered nothing at all. According to the police reports, he had been kidnapped only a few months before. During the interrogation, physical force was used, the chief of Intelligence punched him in the back of the head with a blunt object. His reaction was extremely strange - he convulsed and mumbled something in a language we didn't know. Ten minutes later, it stopped, and the object remembered nothing of what had happened. The results of this 'experiment' were well reproducible. We got a theory that we were thus hitting some device in his brain, which was confirmed after detailed analysis of radiography. Deep in the brain tissue, we noticed tiny artificial object that we had missed in previous studies. We should probably remove this implant and examine it in detail."

  STR_MIB_AGENT_LOBOTOMY_UFOPEDIA: "By dissecting the M.I.B. agent's cranium, we were able to remove a strange implant integrated into the frontal and temporal lobes of the cerebral cortex. The device consists of a miniature power supply, a memory unit, a processor, and a complex receiving antenna. We also found that the centers responsible for long-term memory were practically burned out, probably by a strong electrical impulse."

  STR_REGIONAL_HQ_LOCATION: "Regional M.I.B. HQ"
  STR_REGIONAL_HQ_LOCATION_UFOPEDIA: "Now we can be sure that the Men in Black have some sort of headquarters. It's probably where their operations in the region are planned and prepared, their logistics, and possibly the recruitment of new agents. Most likely, it's a rather large structure, hidden under the guise of a civilian facility. We have only a rough idea of the location of this site, but now we have the capability to pick up traces of signals sent out by the M.I.B. We need to plan a covert operation to scout the area of the alleged headquarters."

  STR_MIB_SCIENTIST_LORE1_UFOPEDIA: "The subject did not exhibit serious detoxification symptoms during the incarceration process. The general condition is broadly similar to the process of withdrawal from hard drugs - withdrawal, fever, cramps, for the first few days, overall vital signs do not indicate life threatening. Unfortunately, no strategically important information could be obtained - the subject could not remember the details of events that had happened to him since last month. Her work consisted of analyzing profiles of human behavior, classifying psychotypes, and designing ways to manipulate public opinion. However, the subject knows nothing about the results of this work - the projects proposed by her were handed over for execution, and other specialists were engaged in analyzing the effectiveness."
  STR_MIB_SCIENTIST_LORE2: "M.I.B. Scientist Interrogation Report #157864"
  STR_MIB_SCIENTIST_LORE2_UFOPEDIA: "From the second day of detention, the subject began to suffer from progressive migraines, memory lapses and hallucinations, and was diagnosed with severe schizophrenia. It seems that the symptoms had previously been successfully managed by a complex of drugs unknown to us - methobolites of high molecular weight organic compounds were found in liver biopsy samples. Apparently, long-term use of these drugs has caused irreparable damage to the subject's liver and kidneys, and he may soon require dialysis.{NEWLINE}Given the severity of the hallucinations, it is unlikely that the readings are to be believed.

  STR_MIB_SCIENTIST_LORE3_UFOPEDIA: "The subject shows pronounced signs of psychopathy, expressed in absolute disregard for the fates and feelings of others. Combined with a brilliant mind and excellent education in psychology and sociology, this allowed the subject to work on ethically and morally monstrous behavior studies of people from different social strata and cultures. The subject designed the methodology of experiments on captive people, projects to manipulate the opinion of governments of different countries and powerful politicians. In most cases, the subject receives feedback on the results of the projects' application in a depersonalized form, without being able to know which people were exposed to the designed techniques."
  STR_MIB_SCIENTIST_LORE4: "M.I.B. Scientist Interrogation Report #324856"
  STR_MIB_SCIENTIST_LORE4_UFOPEDIA: "Almost immediately after the detention, the subject's mental state deteriorated dramatically, manifesting as hysteria, seclusion, refusal to eat, complete disregard for what was going on around him, and several suicide attempts. Eventually, after administering a large dose of antidepressants and a course of sedatives, we were able to proceed with the interrogation. The subject had no recollection of being recruited into M.I.B. and generally did not care much about the motives for her actions. She was assigned to calibrate some equipment that can 'read minds' by sensing the signature of the electromagnetic impulses emitted by the brain as it operates. What is interesting is that the receiving antennas can be several meters away from the observation target, even in another premise. However, for this purpose it is necessary to use special radio-permeable slabs, masticated on the usual floor, ceiling or wall. The signal source is extremely weak, so AI hardware is actively used to filter out third-party interference. Unfortunately, the interrogator does not know the specifics of these devices, as well as the intricacies of the physical principles behind such an astounding sensitivity of the instrument."

  STR_FARM_CATTLE_SAMPLE_RESULT_2: "Biological Sample Study Report #015212"
  STR_FARM_CATTLE_SAMPLE_RESULT_2_UFOPEDIA: "During the examination of the found cow carcass, we performed an autopsy and a thorough examination of all body systems and internal organs and discovered an unusual finding.{NEWLINE}In the stomach of the animal were found fragments of an unknown flora, in its structure and properties it is strikingly different from any known to us plants. {NEWLINE}It was also strange that the fragments of flora remained alive even after the death of the animal itself, but in contact with atmospheric air during autopsy, they immediately died.{NEWLINE}We believe this, coupled with atypical structure and chemical composition, indicates the extraterrestrial origin of the discovered specimens. Apparently, the atmosphere on their home planet is very different in its gas composition from Earth's, making our atmosphere detrimental to them."
  STR_FARM_CATTLE_SAMPLE_RESULT_3: "Biological Sample Study Report #024132"
  STR_FARM_CATTLE_SAMPLE_RESULT_3_UFOPEDIA: "When examining the found fragments of the carcass of a dead domestic cow, we carefully studied the animal's brain and found some oddities. The cerebellum, hind brain and midbrain have quite typical structures. But the forebrain has obvious changes and its structure is different from normal. The forebrain is usually associated with functions such as emotion, behavior, and decision-making (as far as it applies to the cow at all).{NEWLINE}The changes found do not appear to be the effects of natural mutations, trauma, or abnormalities known to science. We speculate that they may have been produced artificially.{NEWLINE}But without more research, we cannot yet say exactly how this was done, and more importantly, why."
  STR_FARM_CATTLE_SAMPLE_RESULT_4: "Biological Sample Study Report #042147"
  STR_FARM_CATTLE_SAMPLE_RESULT_4_UFOPEDIA: "We made a thorough analysis of the animal carcass in search of the cause of the change in the structure of the forebrain. After a great number of experiments and studies, we finally found various types of chromosomal aberrations in the animal. We found translocation (transfer of a chromosome segment to a non-homologous chromosome) in combination with intercalary deletion (loss of a fragment on the inner part of the chromosome) and duplication of some sites.{NEWLINE}Unfortunately, we do not fully understand the mechanism of influence of all the found changes on the parts of the animal's brain. In addition, we admit that our equipment does not allow us to detect the full list of changes.{NEWLINE}But we estimate the probability of accidental occurrence of such a combination of chromosomal changes as close to zero and are quite sure that we are talking about purposeful genetic engineering."
  STR_FARM_CATTLE_SAMPLE_RESULT_5: "Biological Sample Study Report #124879"
  STR_FARM_CATTLE_SAMPLE_RESULT_5_UFOPEDIA: "We have completed a meta-analysis of the collected altered brain regions of the recovered cow carcasses, conducted several additional experiments, and examined the data with testimonies. There is information that local residents have noticed atypical behavior of cattle recently, spontaneously arising and as spontaneously ceasing. The people themselves have noted in themselves and their acquaintance's impulsiveness, irascibility and excessive emotionality on the most insignificant occasions.{NEWLINE}Comparing the collected data, we have come to the frightening conclusion that the facts indicate some kind of large-scale experiment aimed at attempts to suppress the will and establish mind control, conducted in the area. {NEWLINE}We believe that the target of this experiment was primarily livestock, and the brain alterations were made to gain easier access to controlling animal behavior. We have formed the hypothesis that an external stimulus was used to exert an effect-perhaps a sound, light, or other type of radiation produced in a spectrum that is inaccessible to the human senses. When the stimulus was activated, the animals began to behave strangely. Unusual reactions of humans in this case can be considered only as a side effect. We believe that in this experiment, they were not the main purpose.{NEWLINE}But this does not mean that its authors can not plan the next stage of the experiment ..."
  STR_FOREST_CATTLE_SAMPLE_RESULT_1: "Biological Sample Study Report #041574"
  STR_FOREST_CATTLE_SAMPLE_RESULT_1_UFOPEDIA: "The specimen found represents the bodies of two squirrels fused together. Apparently, the process took place rapidly and in adulthood, as the formed tissue mainly consists of scars and contains remnants of wool inside. The genome of both squirrels contains significant changes, with the invasive genes being the same in both individuals. It is not at all clear to us what could have caused this phenomenon."
  STR_FOREST_CATTLE_SAMPLE_RESULT_2: "Biological Sample Study Report #042674"
  STR_FOREST_CATTLE_SAMPLE_RESULT_2_UFOPEDIA: "The body of the boar we found was disfigured by fangs growing over the entire skin surface. The growth was very fast, the fangs were formed under the skin, and when growing they tore it, leaving severe inflammation. The skin cells in the affected areas contain several extra chromosomes with unusual genetic material. We still do not understand the mechanism that triggered this monstrous process."
  STR_FOREST_CATTLE_SAMPLE_RESULT_3: "Biological Sample Study Report #178453"
  STR_FOREST_CATTLE_SAMPLE_RESULT_3_UFOPEDIA: "We examined the body of the deer found by our operatives. Or rather, we examined what was left of it, a mangled heap of decomposing meat, mixed with wool and broken bones. In the very center of the animal we found the remains of an unknown plant, samples of which we managed to bring back to our base. It is unlike any plant known to modern science - its roots are carnivorous, absorbing fats and organic proteins from the surrounding substrate to create a strange shaped fruit in the center of the plant. Unfortunately, in the sample we collected, the fruit is apparently at a very early stage of maturation, and we can't even speculate on what might have grown from it. Oxygen from the atmosphere is destructive to it, practically burning the plant tissue."
  STR_FOREST_CATTLE_SAMPLE_RESULT_4: "Biological Sample Study Report #236783"
  STR_FOREST_CATTLE_SAMPLE_RESULT_4_UFOPEDIA: "Eyes and tongues were missing from the bodies of the forest rodents we found, while other parts were intact. Cortisol and lymphocyte levels in the blood indicate that organs were removed from living individuals, who were then left to die. In most cases, death was due to blood loss. Characteristically, there is a complete absence of infection in the affected areas, as well as signs of decomposition, although decomposition occurs as normal on intact parts of the body."
  STR_FOREST_CATTLE_SAMPLE_RESULT_5: "Biological Sample Study Report #450161"
  STR_FOREST_CATTLE_SAMPLE_RESULT_5_UFOPEDIA: "We found the body of a female rabbit that had died in a painful labor. One cub was able to get out by rupturing the uterus and uterine canal, but the second one remained in the uterus, having died during labor. Apparently, the rabbit was artificially inseminated, and the cubs are extremely altered genetically.{NEWLINE}In the first place, they clearly developed in the body much longer than normal, allowing them to become more robust and be born much more adapted to independent living. In the second place, their lungs have a more complex structure and larger size, and their alveoli are more efficient at trapping oxygen. This combination would allow them to breathe air with much less oxygen and more carbon dioxide."
  STR_ADVANCED_HEALING: "Advanced Treatments"
  STR_ADVANCED_HEALING_UFOPEDIA: "We have done an excellent job, finally managed to synthesize the full analog of the found alien substance in our laboratory!{NEWLINE}It has all the properties of the original - shows excellent antiseptic effect against both bacteria, fungi and viruses.{NEWLINE}We have conducted the minimum necessary (and possible under current conditions) tests on laboratory mice and on volunteers, which proved that the resulting drug is not only extremely effective, but also has no toxicity. We can confidently state that it is completely safe for humans and can be used for healing various types of wounds and burns, including infected ones, as a pre- and post-operative antiseptic and even for treatment of hands of medical personnel before surgery. At the same time, there is an acceleration of healing time and reduction of tissue scarring. This will significantly increase the efficiency of medical services at our base, resulting in reduced recovery time for soldiers.{NEWLINE}{ALT}Wound recovery is reduced by 10%."
  STR_CATTLE_MUTILATION_AGENDA: "Cattle Mutilation Agenda"
  STR_CATTLE_MUTILATION_AGENDA_UFOPEDIA: "We conducted a meta-analysis of all previously collected data and came to the following conclusion. The collected materials exclude all versions of the causes of cattle mutilation, except for the actions of extraterrestrials. Apparently, they are actively studying the Earth's flora and fauna, conducting genetic and population experiments. Extremely disturbing are the indications that they are conducting experiments to establish mass mind control and to adapt alien flora and breed new species of animals adapted to conditions different from those on Earth.{NEWLINE}The ultimate goals of these studies are unclear, it is unlikely that the aliens are driven by mere scientific curiosity. They may be working on scenarios to transform the Earth's ecosystem. Are they capable of doing that? And if so, what will become of our civilization? How long could it take, and can we stop them? It seems there are more questions than before our research began...{NEWLINE}{ALT}Alien knowledge has been improved.{ALT}{NEWLINE}It doesn't seem likely that the study of new samples of alien mutilated animals will fundamentally increase our understanding of the alien's methods and objectives, but the samples collected at the evidence sites may be valuable to our allies. Perhaps they may be able to glimpse something we've missed."
