#cutscenes
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE1_CAPTION: "The Council of Funding Nations is closing the X-Com project and terminating of all its activities. Perhaps this has something to do with the recent changes of Council membership, with several Council members facing clearly fabricated charges. Agents of a top secret intergovernmental organization known to us as the Men in Black have been assigned to the Council as exclusive security force. We are confident that the purpose of this organization extends far beyond the protection services - there are reasons to suspect them of aiding the aliens, and it seems that they are trying to cover up any traces of their activity."
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE2_CAPTION: "The Commander of X-Com has been called to the Council to receive the final instructions. Two days later, he returned to the base accompanied by MiB agents and initiated the 'Oblivion' protocol: an irreversible encryption of the Ufopedia (X-Com's archive of scientific and technological achievements), decreed dismissal of all personnel and issued orders to dismantle the base facilities."
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE3_CAPTION: "All colleagues noticed some peculiar changes in his behavior - communication became more drastic and formal, and there was a steep decrease of empathy. We have already documented such personality changes of some of our field agents, and we assume that this indicates some form of external mind control. You know the Commander well, he would never so easily destroy what we have been working so hard all these years!"
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE4_CAPTION: "Dr. Meyer, chief of the research department, tried to prevent the loss of research data. Unfortunately, he was not a trained spy and was caught trying to back up the Ufopedia. An MiB agent shot him on sight, and the Commander didn't even blink!"
  STR_INTRO2_SLIDE5_CAPTION: "There are still people who are loyal to fighting the alien invasion. To arms!"

  STR_LOG1_UFOPEDIA: "As senior officer, I took command. I hope my experience is enough to cope with the situation.{NEWLINE}Our enigmatic foe is retreating. When our soldiers got to the ground level of the base, remained men in black plunged into two black vans and fled eastwards. The attempt to follow them has failed.{NEWLINE}If you think about it, the situation is no worse - we have lost a funding and supply source and know very little about our enemy. Apparently, alien agents have managed to infiltrate deep into government structures, probably even the Council itself. What is clear is that now we can only count on ourselves.{NEWLINE}In the meantime, it is necessary to gather status reports on the core units and understand what we still have to go. We need to get reports from the chiefs of research, intelligence and logistics. Orders have already been submitted, it will take several hours for analysis. After that, it will be possible to plan further actions."
  STR_RND_STATUS_REPORT: "R&D Status Report"
  STR_RND_STATUS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Hello, Central... Oh, I'm sorry, I mean, hello, Commander! It seems that since Dr. Meyer's death, I'm in charge of the R&D department. Please don't look at my age, I have two PhDs in microbiology and high energy physics and I've been helping Dr. Meyer organize work last six months.{NEWLINE}Now to the point, if you'll let me. Ufopedia is encrypted, and that's what's bothering me the most right now. Jim, the data analyst, says there's still hope! I suggest we begin decrypting immediately.{NEWLINE}Also, we need to interrogate the prisoners we're capturing, perhaps this will help shed some light on what's happening..."
  STR_INTEL_STATUS_REPORT: "Intelligence Report"
  STR_INTEL_STATUS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Oh, Commander! Recent events have tied our hands entirely, all secret government communication channels have been cut off, we will have to build our agent network from scratch. You can assign a couple of scientists to set up new encrypted communication channels. It is essential to set up covert operations conducted by our agents to gather intelligence assets.{NEWLINE}Additionally, we can establish secure contact with our remaining friends, I have a few people I've been watching for a long time. Their help will be invaluable in the given circumstances."
  STR_ENGINEER_STATUS_REPORT: "Engineer's Report"
  STR_ENGINEER_STATUS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Greetings, Commander! Our base was in a very poor condition even before the attack. Due to a lack of funding, we were forced to close several facilities and sell off some valuable equipment. After closing the workshop, our production capacity is at a minimum, we are trying to assemble spare parts from improvised materials. It is absolutely unclear where we will get the supplies from now, at least the most basic ones. Intelligence has forbidden my guys to leave the base, and from where will we get everything we need for maintaining, not to mention building modules? Maybe R&D folks would think about the secure source of the general supplies?"
  STR_VEHICLES_STATUS_REPORT: "Vehicles Status"
  STR_VEHICLES_STATUS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Our vehicles are repaired, refueled, and ready to use. It's just that we don't have radar anymore. The intelligence guys are constantly monitoring reports of UFOs' signs all over the globe, but the real chance of alien ship tracking is very poor. Although if we manage to do that, Stalker-1 is ready for takeoff. Hopefully, it will get luckier than Stalker-2, hit by a burst of plasma. We've got a good deal of ammo left, but we don't have a restocking source - Stingray missiles aren't for sale at the supermarket, you know. The Dragonfly-1 landing craft is ready for full deployment once the mission site located."
  STR_PRISONER_INTERROGATIONS: "Prisoner Interrogations"
  STR_PRISONER_INTERROGATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "I am proficient in many forms of interrogating suspects and believe that this is the most effective way to obtain crucial insights that will help shed light on unfolding events. While some suspects may not have any vital knowledge, I advise you to interrogate all our captives. In addition to strategic intelligence, this will help us determine specific combat features of our enemies and identify their strengths and vulnerabilities. Our prison can hold up to 10 human prisoners, but for more exotic creatures we will have to design suitable containment units according to their biology."
