Some music assets were bought by me and I have personal right to use it in my project - X-Com: From the Ashes, they are distributed under All Rights Reserved license. You can not redistribute or adapt it anyhow without my personal agree. Sorry, it is not my personal greed, but part of agreement with its author. To streamers and letsplayers - this music is safe for you, it is not listed in any contentID systems. Here is a list of those music tracks:

I am also ordered some art assets from professional pixel-artists in order to provide the best experience to my players I can offer. Those orders are partially funded by Patreon support and mostly from my personal budget and I have personal rights to use it. So I maid a decision to distribute those (and only those) assets under All Rights Reserved license. Here is a list of that assets:
